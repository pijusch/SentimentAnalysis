one of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying  it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked . one of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they  the yuppies  are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art . while the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning  i find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner . if these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home  i would bet that american psycho would be one of those movies .
