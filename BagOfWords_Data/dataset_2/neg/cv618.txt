it  s a hideous little production  apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches . it  s an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop  motion animation . it  s weird  but it  s not the kind of fun  weird trip anyone optimistic might expect . it  s the cold  inhuman  unfriendly  sickening  even creepy kind of weird . there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie . after all  disney did a fantastic job with the same source material . and cosgrove  hall did far more attractive things with stop  motion .  br    br   interestingly  this is a french production . as such  it re  enforces the stereotype that the french have no concept of scary .
