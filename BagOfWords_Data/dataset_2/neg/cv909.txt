i agree with one of the other comment writers about good story  good actors but mismatched  and i would also say rushed . it has been about   years since i read the book as it was in school . but i felt that you would need to know the story of jane eyre when watching this one as bits are left out  therefore it doesn  t fully make sense . for example jane  mr rochester have hardly spoken  suddenly he is proposing marriage    the actors don  t have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story . the actors are good but aren  t given enough time to do this story justice . i  m sorry to say it but i didn  t really enjoy this version . the     version with susanna york  george c scott would be the jane eyre movie of my preference but you should check out the     bbc mini series version with zelah clarke  timothy dalton in the  main roles . i love it so much i watch it regularly . there is an abridged version which goes for    mins or the full version for    mins .
