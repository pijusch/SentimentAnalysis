i cannot believe that this movie was ever created . i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse . the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup . the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes . finally  there are maybe five or six zombies total  definitely not a nation . the best part of the movie  if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished . again to reiterate other user comments  the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie . also  there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all . it is never explained .
