how unfortunate  to have so many of my  a  list  and good  b  list actors agree to do this movie  but they did  and that is what sucked me into watching it . i had never heard of this movie  but there was cuba gooding jr . right on the dvd cover  and james woods in the background how bad can it be  in a word very  this movie starts o . k . has some twists and turns  then just lays an egg . the ending was so weak  it was as if the writer got called away and his  year old son sat down at the type writer and hacked out the ending . how ironic a for a movie titled  the end game  to have such a poor one . these are the types of movies that can move  a  list actors to the  b  list in hurry . i hope cuba gooding jr  and james woods don  t make a habit of this .
