that  s not just my considered verdict on this film  but also on the bulk of what has been written about it . now don  t get me wrong here either  i  m not a total philistine  i didn  t hate the movie because it wasn  t enough like  police academy   or whatever  i enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff  i swear .  br    br    magnolia  is poor  and i am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed . long winded  self indulgent  rambling nonsense from start to finish  there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie . there  s some high calibre actors fair enough  and none turns in an average or worse performance . furthermore  my wife  a self confessed tom cruise hater  tells me it  s his career best performance by far . but the plot is so completely unengaging  meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail  s pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something .  br    br   it doesn  t help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with  well i didn  t think so  but i don  t like most people admittedly  . they all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length  demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever  so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route . yadda yadda yadda . the soundtrack  s dire as well  with that marrow  suckingly irritating quality that i had hitherto thought unique to the music of alanis morisette .  br    br   all in all  it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of  friends  whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat . the bit with the frogs is good though .
