about three minutes into this thing i started fast  forwarding  pausing only during the nudity  why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women   . in ten minutes i was done  and wishing i could get my money back from the rental store . the people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the mpaa . come on writers  the bad guys always get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy  s remote control  that  s the way its been done since the days of the ottoman empire  also  to add insult to injury  the  twist  at the end was so formulaic  that it could have come from any action movie written in the past   years . burt reynolds was fine  but he should concentrate on real movies .  br    br   this movie is just a waste of time  run away  run away
