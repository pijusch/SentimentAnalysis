a good deal of running around . a badly conceived adversary with very little complexity . a scientist who works in communications sending off signals into space and receiving them  gets caught up with aliens . along with his pretty wife  he invades their territory and is given secrets about them . he becomes rather traitorous in the process . granted  he is given little choice anyway . there is a scene where he gives them everything they want . this is a dull movie with lots of long stretches where little happens . the plot isn  t technically bad . it  s just that we are usually following a car  a trip through a woods  investigating a building . this is what editing is all about . i suppose the story wouldn  t technically support much more . not much here .
