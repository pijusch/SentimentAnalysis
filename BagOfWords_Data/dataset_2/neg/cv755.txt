spoilers ahead  br    br   this is one of the worst movies ever made  it  s that simple . there is not one redeeming quality about this movie . the first   minutes are quite tricky  they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat . instead  you will spend   minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization . the lake was ridiculous  looked like an aquarium  and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed . characters show their advanced teleportation powers  for example alex thomas who falls into the lake  drunk   and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position . angie harmon put up a pitiful performance as kate  made worse by the space  time continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader . an example of this would be when she said   flashlight   in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half . finally  the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that i have ever seen . it was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists . an example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on alex  s car . i would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie . the ending was absolutely pathetic . the writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say   oh yeah   instead  we  re left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line . unfortunately  there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crap .  br    br   i give this a .  out of    the .  being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book .
