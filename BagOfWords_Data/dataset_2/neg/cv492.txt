i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i  along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience  were vastly disappointed . the movie wasn  t even so bad it was good it was as lifeless as a snake  bite victim . samual l . jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame . it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi movies  except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy . it all seemed worn  flat  and overtly formulaic . i  m shocked to say i actually think anaconda was more fun . it  s easy to understand that soap realizes it  s a piece of sit and plays along with it  but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense . it  s the worst kind of lame movie it  s joyless .
