an ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting  if only you could bring yourself to care . this  twisting and turning  i speak of refers not to the story  which contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole  but to the director  s inability to keep the characters  faces even remotely centered in the frame . on the other hand  angie harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear .  br    br   the only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it . when you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an all  star cast  you might be inclined to think something stinks .  br    br   and indeed  it does .
