this movie was the worst movie i have seen since  date movie .  i was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared . it was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example  the eye  the tongue  the butt  the breast . if we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite . for each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person . i believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior . i cant believe i wasted my money on this movie . so i don  t recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it .
