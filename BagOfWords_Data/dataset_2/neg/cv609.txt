movie industry is tricky business  because decisions have to be made and everyone involved has a private life  too . that  s the very original thesis of this feeble attempt at making an  insightful  film about film . and indeed  no better proof of the industry  s trickiness than seeing anouk aime and maximilian schell trapped in this inanity . the insight consists of talking heads rattle off bullshit like  should i make a studio movie that pays a lot or should i make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self    do the latter  please .  or  our relationship is not only professional  it  s private as well . it  s a rather complex situation to handle  isn  t it    yes  it is  my dear .  between the insipid dialogs one gets glimpses of palm trees  hotel lobbies and american movie posters  no sign of non  american film presence on the croisette  . recurrent slumber sessions are inevitable  making the    minutes of the film feel like ages . jenny gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing in justifying her own presence in the frame .
