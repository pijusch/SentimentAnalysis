this movie was terrible  i rented it not knowing what to expect . i watched the  st  minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb . the acting was bad and there was no plot . the monster is soooooo fake . it growls and its mouth doesnt move . also why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monster . just plain bad don  t even waste your time .   out of
