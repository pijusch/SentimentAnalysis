the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters . the different story lines don  t feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times .  br    br   it may sound weak and clich but it  s true you  re way better of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and terri irwin . it  s more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is . i  m sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn  t give us the viewers much pleasure . for a comedy it simply isn  t funny enough and steve and terri irwin just aren  t good actors  not even when they play themselves  their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene  s feel long  distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times .  br    br   the movie had quite some potential  i mean steve irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch  so when i first heard that they were making a movie about  the crocodile hunter  my first reaction was brilliant  the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters . the movie does has a certain entertainment value  at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still  i must certainly wouldn  t recommend this movie .  br    br   watching this movie felt like a waste of time . still this movie might be watchable just once  when it gets on tv  on a rainy afternoon . it does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential .  br    br
