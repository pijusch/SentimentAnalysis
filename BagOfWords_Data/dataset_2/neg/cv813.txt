the russian movie      follows the lives of three  not four  strangers who meet one night in a local bar . one is a musician  one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl .  br    br       i gather  is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post  soviet russia  the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are   but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it . there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes  operating secret cloning facilities  selling decades  old frozen meat etc .  but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybody  s really up to here .  br    br   despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes     is a two  hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs .
