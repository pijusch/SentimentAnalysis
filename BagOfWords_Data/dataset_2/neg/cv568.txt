note to horror fans the only horror here is when you realized you just wasted   minutes of your life on a movie that  s so worthless it  s insulting .  br    br   i watched this because  br    br   the premise sounded slightly promising it  s not . it  s just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low  budget slasher films that weren  t good either .  br    br   the promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful it  s not . it  s so not . the amateur cinematography makes sure the  fallen angels  are about as sexy as the average homeless person .  br    br   the name tom savini has a long history in the horror genre he  s the king of low  budget special effects and lower  budget acting . come to think of it  savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie . it  s not that he  s bad  but he  s almost always in bad movies . his only good role was in from dusk till dawn  and he  s been milking that at horror conventions ever since .  br    br   but let  s focus on the positive forest of the damned is a great example of how not to make a movie .  br    br   everything else is a negative . obviously the writer is allergic to originality . the script is terrible . that  s all a given after the first   minutes . but the clueless pacing the way the director treats  plot  and  characterization  as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway and the excruciatingly long and boring driving  walking  and nature sequences  no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution  show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general .  br    br   this is another good example of the number  one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad if it  s written and directed by the same person  expect garbage .
