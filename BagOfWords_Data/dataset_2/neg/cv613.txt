this piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow . the sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again  things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear . was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production   br    br   poor film making aside  the story is vile just sick evil sht if you like rape  murder and self harm this is right up your alley . and if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed . i watched almost all of it but had to turn off after i seen someones brains blown out . never before have i seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty .
