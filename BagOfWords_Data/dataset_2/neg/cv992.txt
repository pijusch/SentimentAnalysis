  voodoo academy  features an  academy  like no other  one that houses only six male students in one bedroom . these teenage guys are instructed in religion by a sinister young priest  who enjoys tormenting and comforting them simultaneously . the sole administrator of this  academy  is a young and seductive headmistress  and she retains her handsome charges on a short leash  so to speak .  br    br   sexual overtones abound  and the director obviously has high regard for young male bodies . these young actors occasionally strip down to their designer underwear to sneak about the  academy   and their sexuality is the entire focus of the movie . if you  re not interested in the male form   stay away   br    br   burdened by weak and awkward dialogue  this low  budget exploitation piece just stumbles along with a few laughable special effects tossed in between the yawns . the mood is claustrophobic  with tediously long takes  a handful of cheap sets and few costume changes . these visual elements come interspersed with seemingly unending sequences of banal dialogue  intended as character and plot development . it gives one the feeling it was filmed in three days . . .
