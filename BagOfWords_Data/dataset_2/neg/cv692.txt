  three daring daughters  is a sickly sweet  rose  colored look at divorce  remarriage  and single  parent living . obviously  social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted  takes a cruise  and then dates and marries a band conductor . even when the  its just a movie  phrase excuses the script from addressing real  life problems   daughters  suffers from too many incoherent high  note songs  children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader hose iturbi playing himself . isn  t it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married   br    br   admittedly  this movie was released in the nineteen forties . only a love for old style hollywood romance and comedy could make  daughters  a tolerable film .
