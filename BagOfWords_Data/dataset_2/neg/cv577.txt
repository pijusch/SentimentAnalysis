though frank loesser  s songs are some of the finest that broadway has to offer  they  re bollixed by joseph l . mankiewicz  lethargic staging and uninspired presentation   when it  s over it barely feels like you  ve watched a musical . mankiewicz doesn  t seem to know how to present loesser  s challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect for example  one of the best numbers  the showstopping adelaide  s lament   concludes by having adelaide  vivian blaine  belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge and stubby kaye  s faux  spiritual sit down  you  re rockin  the boat  has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there . mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue  adapted from abe burrows  stage book  has none of the wit that his films like all about eve  have . part of the blame has to go to the leads  just about all of whom are miscast marlon brando looks bewildered as to why he  s in a musical  frank sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential  the songs are not tailored to his style  and jean simmons barely registers the way a shirley jones might . only blaine  as the lovelorn showgirl adelaide  commands our attention like a broadway pro should . the colorful art direction is by joseph wright and howard bristol created the flashy sets .
