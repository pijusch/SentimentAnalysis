lame  lame  lame    a    minute cringe  fest that  s   minutes too long . a setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility  an abandoned convent  is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky  witless dialogue that  s straining oh  so  hard to be hip . mostly it  s just embarrassing  and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat  a sample of this movie  s dialogue after demonstrating her artillery  fast dolly shot to a closeup of barbeau  s vigilante charactershe any questions   hyuck hyuck hyuck  . bad acting  idiotic  homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects  it looks like the director  s watched the evil dead  way too many times .  br    br   i owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they  ll never get back . what a turd .
