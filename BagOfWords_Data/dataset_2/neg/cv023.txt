vijay krishna acharya  s  tashan  is a over  hyped  stylized  product . sure its a one of the most stylish films  but when it comes to content  even the masses will reject this one . why  the films script is as amateur as a  year old baby . script is king  without a good script even the greatest director of all  time cannot do anything . tashan is produced by the most successful production banner  yash raj films  and mega stars appearing in it . but nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland . thumbs down   br    br   performances anil kapoor  is a veteran actor . but how could he okay a role like this  akshay kumar is great actor  in fact he  s the sole saving grace . kareena kapoor has never looked so hot . she looks stunning and leaves you  all stand up . saif ali khan doesn  t get his due in here . sanjay mishra  manoj phawa and yashpal sharma are wasted .  br    br    tashan  is a boring film . the films failure at the box office  should you keep away .
