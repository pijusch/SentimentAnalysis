this movie was a mess . it had the absolute worst editing i have ever seen . it was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial  and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream .  br    br   under the messy direction and editing  there was a glimmer of something good . a good idea  a compelling spark . but somewhere it went wrong .  br    br   the story is about a quasi  psychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders . the first thing that is hard to bite into is richard grieco as a priest . well the part doesn  t call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well . the second problem is dennis hopper as the crazy bad guy . he always plays the crazy bad guy . very ho hum .  br    br   oh  a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy  horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character  grieco  was experiencing . and just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords . not a good sign for any movie .  br    br
