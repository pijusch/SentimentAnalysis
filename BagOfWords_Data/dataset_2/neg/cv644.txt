i saw this last week after picking up the dvd cheap . i had wanted to see it for ages  finding the plot outline very intriguing . so my disappointment was great  to say the least . i thought the lead actor was very flat . this kind of part required a performance like johny depp  s in the ninth gate  of which this is almost a complete rip  off   but i guess tv budgets don  t always stretch to this kind of acting ability .  br    br   i also the thought the direction was confused and dull  serving only to remind me that carpenter hasn  t done a decent movie since in the mouth of madness . as for the story  well  i was disappointed there as well  there was no way it could meet my expectation i guess  but i thought the payoff and explanation was poor  and the way he finally got the film anti  climactic to say the least .  br    br   this was written by one of the main contributors to aicn  and you can tell he does love his cinema  but i would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise .  br    br   i took the dvd back to the store the same day
