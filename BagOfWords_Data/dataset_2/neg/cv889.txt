what was the point of this movie  what was the plot  i do not know . shaq can  t act  people don  t know how to direct  and i am kazaam  a genie who raps  come on . maybe eminem or linkin park will be in a movie like this . i remember i watched this just to kill time . it didn  t really interest me . i just remember thinking   who put shaq in this movie     the whole story seemed stupid too . it made no sense whatsoever . i guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen . i can  t comment much more because this movie is so terrible there  s nothing worth commenting about . i  wish  this movie would go away .
