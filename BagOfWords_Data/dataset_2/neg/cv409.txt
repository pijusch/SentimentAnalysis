as a writer i find films this bad making it into production a complete slap in the face . talk about insulting . i was writing better stories than this in  th grade . bad acting  bad writing  bad directing and when added all together the result is complete and total failure .  br    br   the only thing this movie manages to accomplish is tricking the unsuspecting consumer into wasting their time . who would green light something so poorly written  it  s not artistic  clever  smart  suspenseful  mysterious  scary  dramatic  nothing .  br    br   the characters are flat and boring with no development . the plot is as recycled as an aluminum can . they somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actors who all must be pretty desperate for work or hoping one of these low budget independent movies will turn out to be the next  pulp fiction  . this script should have been used to line a bird cage  not a movie .  br    br   oh and last but not least  a       lb woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice her size without a struggle and in a single blow .  br    br   avoid this bomb like it will infect you with an std .
