i truly wish i was not writing this review . i  m a christian  so i waited anxiously to see this movie . it seemed great   a christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing  not that i buy the bible code itself   you can make it say anything you want . i do  however believe everything inside the bible  . so i  m sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews  when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes . i had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while i was in the theater  i would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scenes  i  m sure  . once the final credits began to roll  however  i could reflect . there were many parts of the movie i liked   some mostly unexpected plot twists  some effects that were indeed special  i  m not counting the visions . those were poorly done   and some interesting technical work   fades  sets  that type of thing . unfortunately  i got the distinct impression that if i read the book of revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour  i could  ve gotten a better script . and the music was beyond cheesy  even for a bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue  . so i wish i could be like everyone else in the theater   like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was   but i  m not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a biblical shell and slaps a christian stamp on it . i need a good plot and believable dialogue before i can enjoy most movies  and this just didn  t have either . i  m sorry  but i wouldn  t recommend this film to anyone . and that  s the tragedy . when will we see some intelligent christian fiction  it has to be out there somewhere . . .
