after watching this on the mst  k episode  i have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from . it seems to combine elements of logans run  farenheight     final sacrifice and at least several others . at one point i was really expecting cris makepease to call lee majors rowsdower .  br    br   i wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot . like the fact that  even though gas is unavailable  there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations  and the stations are located close enough together to keep an f  race car going all the way across the country .
