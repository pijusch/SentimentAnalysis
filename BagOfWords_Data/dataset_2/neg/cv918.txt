this ambitious film suffers most from writer  director paul thomas anderson  s delusions of grandeur . highly derivative of much better material  altman  s  nashville   lumet  s  network    this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere . a couple of misguided detours along the way  an embarrassing musical interlude  a biblical plague  don  t help matters . neither does the uneven level of performances . especially bad william h . macy  whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether julianne moore  for her unconvincing angst . and how many times must we see john c . reilly  s sad sack shtick   chicago  and  the hours  will suffice   tom cruise comes off well by comparison  his misogynist  foul  mouthed holy roller was rather amusing . speaking of foul mouths  the script was so loaded with  f  bombs  they lost their impact in no time . don  t even talk about that awful soundtrack  full of insipid and annoying vocals by aimee mann . her extended rendition of  one   a maudlin number to begin with  drove me to distraction at the start of the film . i should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours  by which time i  d been pushed to the brink of hell . one redeeming feature  which i haven  t seen mentioned in other reviews  is the best performance in the bunch  by unknown melora walters in the role of claudia  the damaged coke fiend bent on self  destruction . her credibility exceeded all others by far . this film took itself way too seriously and just didn  t know when to end .
