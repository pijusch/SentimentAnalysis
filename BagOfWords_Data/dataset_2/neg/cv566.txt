nathan detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in nyc  but the heat is on and he can  t find a secure location . he bets chronic gambler sky masterson that sky can  t make a prim missionary  sarah brown  go out to dinner with him . sky takes up the challenge  but both men have some surprises in store   br    br   this is one of those expensive fifties mgm musicals in splashy colour  with big sets  loud music  larger  than  life roles and performances to match broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing  which i don  t . my main problem with these type of movies is simply the music . i like all kinds of music  from albinoni to zz top  but broadway show tunes in swing time with never  ending pah  pah  tah  dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren  t my cup of tea . this was written by the tag team of frank loesser  mankiewicz  jo swerling and abe burrows  based on a couple of damon runyon stories   and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak . blaine  s two numbers for example are identical  unnecessary  don  t advance the plot and grate on the ears  and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you  . there are only two memorable tunes  luck be a lady  sung by brando  not sinatra as you might expect  and sit down  you  re rockin  the boat  nicely performed by kaye  but you have to sit through two hours to get to them . the movie  s trump card is a young brando giving a thoughtful  laid  back performance he also sings quite well and even dances a little  and is evenly matched with the always interesting simmons . the sequence where the two of them escape to havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise  bustle and vowel  murdering of noo yawk . fans of musicals may dig this  but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show .
