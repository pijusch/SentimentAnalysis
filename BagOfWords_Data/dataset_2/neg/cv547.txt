a difficult film to categorize . i was never giving it     concentration  consequently as simple as the plot appeared i couldn  t say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the american fbi characters  what their roles were . nor could i take the irwins seriously as film characters when their lines  scenes were all in the style of one of his shows  not acted out .  br    br   this is nothing more than a glorified episode of a discovery tv show  with a largely insignificant sub plot going on  which just seemed to get in the way . however as any irwin show is always worth a watch  this film is well worth a look too  but not on christmas day . talking of which  i  ve better things to do too than be on here .  br    br   a high
