i happened to love the show growing up  along with millions of others . so i tuned in to this movie  thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and fun .  br    br   wrong  i just have to wonder  at the end of this  was charlie  s angels really that boring  i don  t seem to remember it as such . but this movie  as bad as movies of this type can be  bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show . i did see it all  in spite of the negatives  it wasn  t unwatchable . but it was very bland  which i do not fault the performers for at all  particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them . the movie just wasn  t that interesting . it tried to make each angel a  character  .  one angel is to feisty  one is the  good girl   one is to into her husband . . . .   all characters were portrayed with one major characteristic defining them and little depth beyond stereotypes . the excitement of the show was missing and the dialog was . . . . dialog . that  s pretty much it .  br    br   not awful . not the worst of tv movies . but missable .
