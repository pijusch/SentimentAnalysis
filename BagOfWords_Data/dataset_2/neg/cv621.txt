spoiler warning  br    br   first of all i rated this movie  out of   .  br    br   the idea is good  but there are too many stupid errors in the movie  failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been . first of all she never fights alone . after an initial very strange doubt from her mother  which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie  the rape victim is not alone .  br    br   she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the crew  s strange traps .  br    br   her friends are unbelievably nasty .  br    br   the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon . ethan is very much the leader of the crew  hey  they even say so  and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk  but when ethan changes his opinion he just doesn  t manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong . everyone just simply hates him . . . why   the movie provides no explanation . how did he ever become the leader   br    br   a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in . two actors from the same successful tv  series . . . . a cheap way to get viewers
