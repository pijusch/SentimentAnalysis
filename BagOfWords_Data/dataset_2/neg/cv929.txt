i can  t tell you how angry i was after seing this movie . the characters are not the slightest bit interesting  and the plot is non  existant . so after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other  hoping that the past  and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish  what do we get    a storm of frogs . now yes  i understand the references to the bible  exodus  and the underlying theme  but first of all  it was presented with absolutely no resolution  and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible  a significant portion of the population  or charles fort  a still larger portion  . as a somewhat well read person  i thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode .  br    br   don  t waste your time . it would be better spent reading . . .  br    br   . . . well anything to be honest
