i feel totally ripped off . someone needs to refund the   .   i spent at blockbuster to rent this homemade mess . this is not a musical it is a complete waste of time and my evening . what i don  t get is why did this get distributed in the first place    . . . somebody must have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made . i  ve seen better films come out of film schools and i have been to film school so i can say that as a fact . the quality of this work is also just so very bad to view . . . shot on dv    nuff said . the songs are not songs but just banter that sounds the same in every section . want to see a good musical  then don  t rent this movie .
