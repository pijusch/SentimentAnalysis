there is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie . is it the lawyer played by kenneth branagh that we  re supposed to be pulling for  well  let  s see   we learn he  s a sleazebag defense attorney who gets criminals off on technicalities . he treats his coworkers like cattle  gets them involved in his own personal crisis  in the process  getting one of them killed   jeopardizes the safety of his kids  threatens his ex  wife  s new boyfriend  tries to strong  arm the police and school administrators   and all this for what  because he was thinking with his little head  i was really pulling for the father and his gang to beat the stuffing out of the lawyer and drown him in the swamp . . . it would have made for a far more satisfying ending .
