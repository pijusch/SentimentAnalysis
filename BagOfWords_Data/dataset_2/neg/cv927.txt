great cast . great acting . unpredictable story line for the first half  br    br   hour or so . i was really wanting to know what was going to  br    br   happen to each of these unredeeming characters  and how their  br    br   seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined . but when  br    br   the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players  they  br    br   mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill  br    br   for the last two hours . i kept thinking it would get better  but it only  br    br   got worse . don  t believe the reviews . this is a waste of time .  br    br   think about it   tom cruise made ugly   why  the gorgeous  br    br   hunky bartender wearing braces   why  i know it had to do with  br    br   the plot  but without them  at least there would have been one  br    br   attractive cast member to remember .
