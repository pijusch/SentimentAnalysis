such a long awaited movie . . but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day . . from the trailers it looked like a action movie  but it turned out to be a out  out comedy  a bad comedy  . but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors  they  ve done their part of the movie very well . good acting  but i don  t think that can save the movie . . india has been shot beautifully . kerala  rajasthan   ladakh   were all saturated with color  alright . nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there     br    br   action sequences were shot very shabbily  no one could make out head  tail of the stunts  they  ve used akki  akshay kumar  very well but could  ve been done much much better . .  br    br   animation is the worst i  ve seen in recent movies     s movies had better animation scenes i guess  initial scene where the car is falling off  flying should be better word  the road into lake  .  br    br   and the movies name has been mentioned nearly every   to   mins  just to make sure audiences don  t forget the movie name i guess . .
