without wishing to be a killjoy  brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichd films i  ve ever seen  this being one of them  and camp blood being another .  br    br   the acting is terrible  the print is shoddy  and everything about this film screams  seriously  you could do better yourself  . maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap   br    br   i bought this for    but remember  you can  t put a price on   minutes of your life . you  d do well to avoid this turkey  even at a bargain basement price .
