i recently watched this again and there  s another version which is shorter     . i get the feeling they are the same movie but i would like to know the difference .  br    br   one is japanese and no pikachu short is all i can come up with . ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice    br    br   prof ivy was rather boring . she sounded as if she was almost asleep  no expression at all with the few lines she had .  br    br   this was enjoyable enough but there wasn  t much to it at all .  br    br   a collector  whos after lugia  he has no plan to destroy the world  and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture lugia causes a lot of destruction .  br    br   the pokemon movies that follow are slightly better  deoxys  poke   is great  with no .  almost here .
