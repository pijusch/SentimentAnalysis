proof that not everything tarantino touches turns to gold . this is most definitely plastic  all the way . its easy to see that without quentin  s involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years  that  s assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place . it is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes  angela jones is unconvincing in this role  william baldwin is better as the serial killer who keeps jones in employment  . all in all pretty poor .
