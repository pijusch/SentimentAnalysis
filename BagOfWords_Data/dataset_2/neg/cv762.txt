end game started well  the least said about the end the better . it seemed like things we  re happening just to keep the plot going  for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive  intelligent person  half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character  we are given no reason for this apart from  the next scene wouldn  t make sense without it . the whole story could have been told in about   minutes  it would have made an average tv political drama the brilliant cuba gooding jr . is very watchable however and james woods does an admirable job considering .  br    br   the end game was honestly one of the worst films i  ve ever seen . . . . . . and that  s saying something  i  ve seen gigli .
