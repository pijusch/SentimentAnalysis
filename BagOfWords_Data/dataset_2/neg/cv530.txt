i sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort of dominican movie industry . the first   minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society  men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do  the movie falls . becoming boring and not funny at all . they let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable . i didn  t like the way as a roberto angel played his character and his little either . i went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but i went out really disappointed .  br    br   i don  t recommend this movie .
