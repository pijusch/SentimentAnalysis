rarely have i witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent . there is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film . what few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings . actors of stature  robert duvall  robert downey  jr .  are deployed in roles which go nowhere a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee  stained camera lens a writer  john grisham  who has never produced anything of merit  discovers new depths of under  motivated incoherence . the film has a cheap  lecherous feel about it  but barely at the level of commentary  its really part of the aesthetic . normally  i come on to the imdb to write balanced  generally appreciative comments . this egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless  bilious rant . i won  t  but only because i no longer want to occupy my  mind  with this trash .
