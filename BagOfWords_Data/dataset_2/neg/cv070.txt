now i have never ever seen a bad movie in all my years but what is with songs in the movie what physiological meaning does it have . wow some demented pokmon shows up and they multiply i can get a seizure from this . animie is pointless the makers of it are pointless its a big marketing scheme look just cut down on songs and they will get a good rating i reckon that this movie would have been fine if they put out a message you must see all the pokmon episodes to understand whats going on and it is not a film . it is just an animation it should be on video .  br    br   ps i  ll give it a  because i just got  bucks i could not give it a half because there  s no halves .
