i saw this movie in its own time period  when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life  but stamped your child as a bastard . in these days of  single mothers  that may seem very far  fetched  but it was very true . and i  m not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering  either . between these two problems i had difficulty finding this movie funny . at that time i didn  t know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had . i did know who betty hutton was  and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic . i loved  bringing up baby   but i find this movie just embarrassing . i  m sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked  but i was the one needing a drink after watching this again . the idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to  get married  and get pregnant just added to the misery . an entire town could turn on you under these circumstances  so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part . of course  shoot me  i don  t like  it  s a wonderful life  either .
