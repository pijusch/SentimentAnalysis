interesting to read comments by viewers regarding omega code . . . many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from tbn broadcasts . . . the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video  to be stocked besides the three  part rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the   s . . dont remember it  you wont remember this one either in a year or two . this is the first movie i have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls . . . very shameful . . . this just goes to show that if you are a televangelist  s son  you too can play high  roller hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe money . . .
