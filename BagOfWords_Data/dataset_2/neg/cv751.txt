i rented end game  having never heard of it  but i  m fond of political thrillers so i thought i  d give it a shot . after doing some research on the movie  i found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release  but instead had gone strait to dvd . after seeing it  i  m thinking   no wonder .  the movie is shocking in its unoriginality . the plot and the characters are perfunctory . i figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball . i have to say  i didn  t expect it to end quite the way it did  but that  s not a point in its favor . the more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad . perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist   even one that made the movie even worse .  br    br   stay away . i want the   .   and my    minutes back .
