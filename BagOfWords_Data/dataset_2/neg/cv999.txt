pros nothing  br    br   cons everything  br    br   plot summary a female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies .  br    br   review never in my life have i come across a movie as bad the zombie chronicles . filmed on a budget of what looks to be about   bucks  tzc is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame  forgetable actors whom couldn  t act to save their lives and gore that  s more gross than frightening . how does a movie like this even get made  simply put  avoid tzc like a sexually  transmitted disease .  br    br   my last  cents humorously enough  this movie was made by a movie company called brain damage films . they  re brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this .  br    br   my rating  out of    if it were up to me  this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion
