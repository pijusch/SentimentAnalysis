i am a youth pastor  s wife and we took some youth to see this film . we then spent an hour trying to explain it to them . they didn  t get it and i didn  t enjoy it . it is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world  the bible code  the torah code and the code in the koran  and is so questionable as to be laughable . this is not a step forward for christians in the arts  it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door .
