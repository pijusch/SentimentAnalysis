admirably odd  though mean  spirited comedy  drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the houston astrodome . robert altman  directed quasi  comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight . some of the cinematography is evocative  shelley duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide  and sally kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as bud cort  s vision of a  mother bird   imagine altman and producer lou adler explaining that role to her   . in the lead  bud cort is   once again  after  harold  maude    a true original not off  putting like  say  michael j . pollard  cort manages to be geeky  wacky and inoffensive  a tough act to pull off . unfortunately  this is one of altman  s misfires . he can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else  but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he spirals downward .  from
