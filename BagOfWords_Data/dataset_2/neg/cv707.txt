i do regret that i have bought this series . i expected more action  more objective picture and more consistency . this is just a pure propaganda series  very dark  without any charm  or romanticism  it is just boredom itself . i find the actors work quite weak as well . o  donnell might seem charming as robin  with batman   but in this picture he lacks any charm . probably while he becomes older  he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up . it comes as no surprise  that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for    of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands .
