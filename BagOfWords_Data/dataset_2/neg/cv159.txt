flight of fury takes the mantle of being the very worst steven seagal flick i  ve ever seen . . . up to now .  br    br   it  s a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest  seagal isn  t really trying in this  he  s fat and his voice is dubbed once more .  br    br   the co  stars fare no better  being a rather sorry load of  rd raters .  br    br   the direction by keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that he  s also responsible for another couple of seagal stinkers  shadow man  attack force  the screenplay co  written by seagal himself is laughably inept .  br    br   according to imdb    m was spent on this boring load of old tosh  if these figures are correct i sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was spent .  br    br   flight of fury is actually a shot for shot remake of the michael dudikoff flick black thunder  which has to be better than this tripe .  br    br   this has no redeeming qualities whatsoever  give it a miss      out of
