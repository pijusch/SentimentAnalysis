apparently  the mutilation man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self  mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood . i use the word  apparently  because without listening to a director andy copp  s commentary  which i didn  t have available to me  or reading up on the film prior to watching  viewers won  t have a clue what it is about .  br    br   gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching the mutilation man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real  life footage  but unless they  re also fond of pretentious  headache  inducing  experimental art  house cinema  they  ll find this one a real chore to sit through .  br    br     minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis  chordant sound  terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue  this mind  numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one  s sanity if you  ve still got all your marbles  you  ll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead  i watched the whole thing  but am well aware that i  m completely barking   .
