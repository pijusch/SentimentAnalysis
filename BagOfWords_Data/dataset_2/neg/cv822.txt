this movie starts out with a certain amount of promise but  in my view  begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down . that this well  meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough  but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family  s life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories .  br    br   i found this movie average at best . art direction could have been much better  as could have been cinematography . the acting was good  and so was eva van der gucht  s singing .
