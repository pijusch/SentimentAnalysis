stranger than fiction angered me so much  i signed up on imdb just to write this review . stranger than fiction is a surprisingly complex  touching and thought  provoking movie until the very end . once you suspend multiple lapses of logic  why didn  t will ferrell hear emma thompson  s voice   years ago when she fist started writing her book   the phone rang . the phone rang again .  how could she not know it  s him calling  etc .   the movie challenges one  s thoughts about mortality  fate  and sacrifice .  br    br   the brief history of literary themes provided by dustin hoffman should especially entertain former english majors . and maggie gyllenhaal is always a pleasure  even though will ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul . her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith .  br    br   ah  but the ending . until the very end  i would have given  out of   stars to this movie . the movie as a metaphor for life  s journey  as a tribute to the notion of  writing true   as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy  but not both  is outstanding . the entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of will ferrell  s fate . and no matter how endearing a character he may have become  we know full well why we will accept the ending . the last act occurs  the screen goes white  the credits roll . a profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film . an end that would have been debated for weeks .  br    br   no           no credits rolled . say it isn  t so . say hollywood didn  t tack on another   minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie . dustin hoffman got it right when he said   it  s no longer a masterpiece it  s ok .  an apt review of the movie . except to me  it wasn  t even ok . i was so offended about the betrayal of  writing true   about the decision to pander the film that i actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie . i don  t often cry . i could care less about most movies  but i am still angry about this one .  br    br   my questions for zack helm  the writer  are this did the original movie end when the screen went white  and were you forced by the vapid movie powers  that  be to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie  or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself  i  ve read you  re brilliant . i hope your original script ended the movie the first time .  br    br   i know zack helm will never see this review  and i  ve been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself . but  please  movie  goers  am i the only one who feels this way about stranger than fiction  one good thing came from me seeing this movie i doubly admire lost in translation now .
