i actually intended to see this movie in the theatre . it was actually sold out . i actually went to see solaris instead  which actually was the worst movie to be released in     .  br    br   victor rosa  john leguizamo   a tough  streetwise  street pharmacist   freaks out when he sees a kid get shot  so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with jack  peter sarsgaard  . things seem to be going pretty well until jack skips town with his girlfriend trish  denise richards  . this happened very late in the movie  so had they not revealed this in the preview  it might have been an interesting twist . but they did  so it  s not .  br    br   in fact  there  s not a single interesting thing about this movie everything is given away in the preview . if you saw even one preview  you saw the whole movie  so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps . go to the website  download the preview  save yourself   .   . there is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film  other than how terrible the soundtrack is .  br    br   i hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired . twice . most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were ricky martin and gloria estefan duets  and  i may shatter the fabric of the space  time continuum with a concept as mind  numbing as this  they both had less talent and musical ability .  br    br   the acting is at best poor  the script is at best a crime against humanity  and denise richards is at best    styrofoam and    ziploc bag . you know things are bad when john leguizamo  he was in the pest   upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities .
