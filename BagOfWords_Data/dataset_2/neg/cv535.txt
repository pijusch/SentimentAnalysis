one of the worst films i have ever seen . how to define  worst   i would prefer having both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again . somehow  one  hit wonder zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends elvis fans  mary kay saleswomen  las vegas  gays  fbi agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy  sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed . how elvis presley enterprises could allow the rights of actual elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be  the only good elvis presley imitator is a dead one  is beyond me . the worst part of this mess  and that takes some work  is the mangled script in      elvis  words and songs that he would speak  perform in the      s are quoted  worst special effect  that oscar would go to the moron who decided that elvis  grave  potentially the most photographed  recognizable grave in the world  resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere . potentially  this film  s biggest audience would be elvis fans . however  the rampant stupidity  nixon gave elvis a dea badge  not fbi credentials . . . and i could go on and on  actually undercuts that conventional wisdom . ugh . i used the word  wisdom  to describe this stupid movie . this is truly a horrible  horrible film .
