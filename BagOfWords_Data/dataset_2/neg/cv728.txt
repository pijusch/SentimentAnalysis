what can i say . a kamal hassan movie being horrible . he acts very well  but it is a horrible story  along with horrible direction . in my kind opinion  the director gautham menon must give up directing . there is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie . apart from that  one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes . there was no practicality in the movie . gautham is just running out of stories . but both kamal hassan and jyothika act really well . the villains look too ugly  though their performance was not bad . i do not think this is a sunday afternoon movie like padayappa which you can see with the family . you will not get sleep seeing this movie   however  harris jayaraj again did a great job  and that is why i have given this movie  out of   . his song  partha modail nallae  is soulful and soothing . apart from that  great cinematography . on the whole  this is just a bad  bad movie . kamal hassan  i think  should have rejected this movie .
