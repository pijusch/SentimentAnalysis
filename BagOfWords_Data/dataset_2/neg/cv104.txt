mt little sister and i are self  proclaimed horror movie buffs . we have seen just about everything  especially zombie flicks . now  we have seen a lot of good zombie movies  and a lot of bad ones . this by far is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life . not only was the acting horrible  but the special effects  graphics and ever  zombie  make  up was the worst i have seen . if you can even call it make  up  black eye shadow around the eyes  this is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it  s cover . cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about . do your selves a favor and do not watch this movie                   i was so adamant about this movie i went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying  this movie sucks  don  t waste your time  return now  hahahhaa i don  t want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this pos movie  i don  t even know how it got the ratings that it did  t should be in the negative
