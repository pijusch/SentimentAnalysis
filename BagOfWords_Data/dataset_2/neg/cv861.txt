when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it couldn  t fail . i love billy crystal  my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it .  br    br   we were misled  in spades .  br    br   on my part  i felt billy crystal  s character was extremely one  dimensional and did very little for the film . sure  he cracked a couple of good jokes  but as a character he did nothing but take up space .  br    br   and poor julia roberts . in past shows she plays well as a strong  willed  self  determined lady . in this flick  she seems completely repressed and had very little fire . this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watching .  br    br   ok  if i were to find one good thing  it would have to be christopher walken . now that  s entertainment . but  just like billy crystal  hardly anything is shown of his character .  br    br   if you  re looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value  go see it . but if you  re looking for a smart  romantic comedy  this is not your film . it  s none of the above .
