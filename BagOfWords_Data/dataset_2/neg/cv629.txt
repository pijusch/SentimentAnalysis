i thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part . since i am a filmmaker  i give it a  for consistency .  br    br   the problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most  if not all  previous successful war stories . the computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story . i was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with  but did not find that information .  br    br   it seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged . the actors weren  t bad  but the plot needs more innovation .
