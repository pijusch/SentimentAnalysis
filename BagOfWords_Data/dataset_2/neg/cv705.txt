there is a remark that one of heroines was raped on  drunken rampage  by russian soldiers  which is completely untrue . this movie should not be shown only because of this .  br    br   also there is a statement by someone  that kgb prosecuted  jews  gypsies etc   which is  worse than nazis  . kgb was looking for so called  zionist  agents  who were  kgb believed  imperialist agents . this is totally different from targeting jewry as a whole nation  as nazis did . gypsies were never prosecuted . kgb was political tool and used politically  but from internationalist standpoint . communists really did not distinguish between nationalities .  br    br   whole movie stinks like fake . main hero does not speak russian  signs in berlin contains typographical errors  kgb general looks totally phony . some so called  russian proverbs  are totally made up  and list goes on and on .  br    br   not recommended to watch  this movie is full of lies  and phony stuff . go to  good shepherd  instead .
