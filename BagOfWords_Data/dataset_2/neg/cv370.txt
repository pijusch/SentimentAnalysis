what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe . during the first season  dark angel was on my weekly  must see  list  and not just because of jessica alba .  br    br   unfortunately  the powers  that  be over at fox decided that they needed to  fine  tune  the plotline . within  episodes of the season opener  they had totally lost me as a viewer  not even to see jessica alba   . i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish . the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin . on one of the second season episodes  they even had max sleeping and dreaming  where the first season stated she biologically couldn  t sleep .  br    br   the moral of the story  the one that hollywood never gets   if it works  don  t screw with it   br    br   azjazz
