what happened  what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast  but somewhere the movie loses it . actually  it never really got going . there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant  then find out that she is after all  but that was it . steve martin  who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie  was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie  other than to make it longer . i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters  kate and angie  and maybe try not for a pure comedy  which unfortunately it was not  but maybe a drama with comedic elements . i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot .
