anyone that has see tammuz  s child eaters knows that this is a director that can do better . let  s hope it was not a case of too many hands in the pot  telefilm anyone   and that is was a case of second feature jitters . the characters are one dimensional and over used . the scenery is terrific however and showcases the pacific northwest beautifully .  br    br   the cinematography is great . shot almost entirely outside  the images are crisp and beautiful . you can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves .  br    br   technically this movie is as sound as they come  it just lacks a heart .
