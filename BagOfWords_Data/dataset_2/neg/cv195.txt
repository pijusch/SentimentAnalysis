major league back to the minors         br    br   starring scott bakula  eric bruskotter  corbin bernsen  dennis haysbert  jensen daggett  written and directed by john warren    minutes rated pg     for language and some violence   br    br   by blake french  br    br   believe it or not  in the new john warren comedy  major league back to the minors  there is one funny scene . it consists of a sequence where an infuriated coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the cement and bounce back and smash him in the face . it  s not much  but with the exception of a few one  liners  it  s all this film has to offer . . . enough said .  br    br   this movie is not only structurally impaired  characteristically undeveloped  predictable and badly written  but also just plain bad . even non  critical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got . it is so familiar it just isn  t funny .  br    br   how many times does the same movie about sports have to be made  last years we saw this same material in  air bud golden receiver   and as bad as that film was  this is even worse . at least  air bud  was family oriented .  major league back to the minors  is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a sunday afternoon . it is too childish for adults . so who is this film for  teenagers  elderly  people who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this   br    br   the film  like many others like this  has one basic point it tries to make teamwork conquers all . yes it does  and what a great moral to try to prove . too bad we have already seen and excepted it so many times over and over have such little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in a ballerina costumes . where the silly announcers form their own  buddy comedy routine  muttering one liners to themselves like  they suck    this kids fast ball is timed with an hour glass    this guy dropped out of ball for a while to find something he lost   maybe it was his mind    somebody needs a nap   and  ever see a sunset as beautiful as that play .  where the characters have such little significance to each other that we never know them by name . and where the only heartfelt lecture scene about teamwork is so unknowledgeable that it is almost funny .  br    br     major league back to the minors  is so bad it stalls its trite ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence . the good baseball team is on a comeback  they are about to win and   the power goes out . i was thinking for a minute that this piece of trash had come to a conclusion  but in reality  its false final scene exists only to add minutes to the running time . the movie basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw in so many putrid jokes it is are not funny . there is another kind  of  funny line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long time outfielder is not wanted in that position any longer . the coach  s answer  you  re too old  too slow  and too fat .  the player  s reaction is to die for . but that scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of you time  and certainly is not worth a cent of your money .  br    br   so here is another dreadful entre into this genre of film  another that is doomed with its own script  which is failed before seen  and another which is so familiar it seems like deja vu all over again .  br    br
