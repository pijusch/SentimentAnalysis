last of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films and a good thing too  as this is easily the worst of the   films he made over a period of   years . no mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people  who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride . she finds tarzan and jane  who try to protect her . george zucco is present as a potentially villainous high priest but isn  t used to his full advantage . also on hand and worthy of mention is a hugely annoying guitar player  singer who goes into song every so often . even the  great  robert florey can  t aid this one .  br    br        of four
