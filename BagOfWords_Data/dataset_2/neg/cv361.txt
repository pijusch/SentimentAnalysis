this series just gets worse and worse . poorly written and just plain not funny  the premise is excellent  but the writer  s inexperience shines through . by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone . now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about  and resorted to that patronizing  smug   oh  silly you  style acting that comes with a no laugh script . they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say  aren  t we zany  isn  t this funny  well  no  it  s not actually . gum disease is less painful . no wonder  with the exception of corner gas  canadians generally avoid canadian tv . come on cbc you  re suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent . pull the plug on this amateurish mess .
