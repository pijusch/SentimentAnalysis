yes i admit i cried during this movie . it was so incredibly disappointing  that i couldn  t help myself but cry . tbn  trinity broadcasting network  has done it again . first with having the million dollar man  ex  professional wrestler  on their program  and now this .  br    br   the omega code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies . it was quite amusing  yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate . the movie follows what is known as  the bible code  rather than following actual biblical scripture . this film is extremely poorly made from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting . its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie . it appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the usa channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie .  br    br   i highly recommend you do not watch this movie  even if your life depended on it .
