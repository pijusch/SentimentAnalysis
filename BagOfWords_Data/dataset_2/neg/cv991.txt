this is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be . i dread to think what the blockbuster  approved edit must have looked like  because the director  s cut on dvd was a bore of the epic proportions . naturally  you don  t expect it to be  the godfather   but an acting class or two might have come in handy .  br    br   also  there were so many cute guys in this movie  but they were woefully under  exploited . i like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their bvds as much as the next guy  but even i have a right to expect a little more . it wasn  t a total loss  though at least we got a peek a drew fuller  s  covered  junk and truly upsetting haircut . and there  s huntley ritter looking even cuter than he did in  bring it on   and acting about as well  . there  s always a silver lining  kids . you just have to look really hard for it . and occasionally  you have to make use of your pause button .
