according to imdb takashi miike  s master of horror  segment  imprint  was banned in the us . so i figured i  d translate the swedish review i just wrote for it . . .  br    br   it was hard to not have any sort of expectations from ichi the killer  director takashi miike  s episode in the masters of horror series . and the dvd  cover of imprint did in deed look very promising .  br    br   the story mostly takes place in a remote japanese bordello  some time during the   th century  and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for komomo  the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for . tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello  hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey . it turns out that one of the prostitutes  a deformed and quiet girl  know about komomo  and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left . the story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallow . . .  br    br   the first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent american  english . but i will leave it at that  it  s not that big a deal . what is a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was . miike  s tale moves at such a slow pace that i couldn  t help looking at my watch several times during the   minutes . the extended torure  scene  that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie  felt so unmotivated  and pornographically intrusive  that not even that scene became interesting . i felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself  with no sense of style or purpose . the only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing water . . . and  in all honesty  the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgust .  br    br   the journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by billy drago  for me most memorable as frank nitti  al capones whiteclad assassin in brian de palmas the untouchables       . i  ve always found dragos portrayal of nitti to be very icy  and i mean that in a good way   and that is probably why i was almost annoyed when i found him to be so terrible  not in a good way  in this one . his acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting . when his character is supposed to react to the awful things komomo has been subjected to i was sitting in the sofa  twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by drago . i  m grateful that most of the story is told by yuoki kudoh  memoirs of a geisha        who plays the deformed prostitute .  br    br   the finale is probably supposed to be chocking  maybe even revolting and horrid  but i just found it to be kind of . . . you know . . .  blah   and i looked at my watch again  for the umptieth time  just wishing the crappy episode would end  . maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit  but that  s only because i couldn  t help thinking of an episode of red dwarf  and the upside  down chins of craig charles and danny john  jules  with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens . . . lucky you  if you  ve seen that episode and now decide to see imprint  i will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for you .  br    br   my first thought  when imprint finally ended  was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it  was hearing the main title theme by edward shearmur  the same music i believe is used in every episode of this series   and that  if anything  is a big friggin warning  don  t you think   br    br   one might point to the costume design  by michiko kitamura  and say that there  at least  is something not lacking in style and refinement . . . but there are so many other films and tv  shows that is so much better at showing off the japanese  geisha  fashion  . this is nothing but inferior and i am disappointed . takashi miike  s masters of horror  episode is boring  uninspiring and pointless . in other words it  s really  really bad
