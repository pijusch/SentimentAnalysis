this film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in california . she thought it was wonderful because it was so real   just the way people in the ohio valley are   i  m from the area and i experienced the film as  just the way people in california think we are   i  ve lived in marietta and parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there . we laughed a lot  we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age the young people went out together at night . the older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families . the area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else .  br    br   aside from the  if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed  condescension  the story lacked any elements of charm  mystery or even a sense of dread .  br    br   martha  s character was the worst drawn . it  s doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church  but if she had  she probably would have made friends there . i  ve read reviews that seem to assume martha was jealous of rose because rose was  younger  prettier and thinner  but if this is the case it isn  t shown . all we actually see is martha learning to dislike rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender . we see martha feeling left out during smoking sessions  left out of the loop when social plans are made  used but not appreciated  and finally disrespected and hurt .  br    br   just one more thing are we supposed to suspect kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks  please . this takes stigma against mental illness to a new level .
