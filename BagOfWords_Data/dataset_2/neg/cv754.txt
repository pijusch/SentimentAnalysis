only a handful of the segments are engaging here . a segment with a garage attendant from nigeria is heartbreaking . one with fanny ardent  bob hoskins makes its point  twist by twist until the final shot overplays things .  br    br   the problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke paris . the others are so scatter  shot in theme  tone  volition  production that you may as well be watching  the years best commercials      .  it  s really all over the place . it doesn  t develop over it  s running time  and nothing reigns the directors in . no construct successfully joins the pieces . . . tedium sets in . i  m at the one hour  twenty minute point and elijah wood is in some dumb  over  commercial  overproduced vampire shtick . it has about as much to do with paris as old ladies knitting in the antartic . fantasy shows up i think first in the coen brothers segment  uh  thanks j  e for ruining another movie  and then makes way too many appearances . the point of being in paris is that you don  t need make  believe crap to make your days extraordinary . why divide it by neighborhood if quartier de la madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director  has there ever been a genre more over  represented than the vampire film . every three years we get the same lame vampire clichs .  br    br   making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless . the transitions get lost . this doesn  t feel intentional  it feels sloppy .
