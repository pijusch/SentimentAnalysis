this movie is so bad it  s funny . it stars scott backula as some coach  but that  s not important  what is important is the large black fellow who plays  st base . first off he has to be at least   years old  yet still plays minor league baseball  second he starts out the movie in the outfield despite not being able to walk  let alone run . coach backula brilliantly moves him to first citing the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time . backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film   spoiler   he tells his star player  downtown  to hit a home run  clearly  downtown  viewed this as a good move . he hit the home run and won the game for his team  a minor league squad playing the twins who were the class of the majors in the movie . now if only tony muser  manager of the royals  would be as smart a coach as backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat  the royals would never end an inning let alone lose a game .
