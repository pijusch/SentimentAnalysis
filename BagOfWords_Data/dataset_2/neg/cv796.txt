i give this a generous four out of ten stars  or dots or markers  or something .  br    br   there were a grand total of two really really funny scenes in this movie . all the scenes with amy p and tina fey and greg kinnear  greg kinnear    moved along agreeably enough .  br    br   otherwise  the usual trafficking in stereotypes  blazing speed  rudely pushed along by a stupid soundtrack  and  soundtrack  is generous .  br    br   anyway  the two really really funny scenes involved amy p . she  s just really hilarious in an animal kind of way . she  s a mixture of that ape man skit that they do on snl and lucille ball .  br    br   i hope they  amy p and tina fey  just flat out admitted they did this for the money  because if by doing it  it gave birth to the sarah palin parodies  then i guess we can say  yeah  it was worth it to put the black guy back into the servant man role  who  s really there to help you be more human .  br    br   blah .  outta   like i said is generous .  br    br   but no more  girls  ok  oh  i almost forgot . the mom from  two and a half men  is in this movie  and she  s had some kind of plastic surgery  so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a   year old  so every scene she  s in  i  m like trying to rearrange her face  or put it together in my mind  or just answer the question   no . wait . wait . has she had plastic surgery   because as a viewer  you really don  t want her to have had plastic surgery .
