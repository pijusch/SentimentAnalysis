have not watched kids films for some years  so i missed  here come the tigers  when it first came out .  never even saw  bad news bears  even though in the    s i worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie   warriors    man who would be king   and  rocky horror picture show   among others .  now i like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on . just minutes into this movie i could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things   at least watching for his  her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren  t doing the job . lo and behold  i spied wes craven  s name in the credits as an electrical gaffer . he  d already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created freddie krueger or made the  scream  movies . maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic . more surprising was fred j . lincoln in the cast credits as  aesop   a wacky character in the movie . f . j . lincoln  from the    s to just a few years ago  appeared in and produced adult films . he was associated with the adult spoof  the ozporns   and just that title is funnier than all of  tigers  attempts at humor combined . let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel .
