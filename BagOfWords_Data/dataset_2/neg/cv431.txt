director kevin connor and wannabe action  hero  romantic lead doug mcclure  re  team in this ghost story set in japan . they had been moderately successful together in the      s  with the likes of  the land that time forgot          at the earth  s core        etc . without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though  the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way .  br    br   the film begins with a prologue set in the   th century  with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide . a move forward to the present introduces married couple ted  laura  visiting japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place .  br    br   no surprises as to what happens next  with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend alex  mcclure  assuming the role of the wife  s lover .  br    br   everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant  to an inevitable  but surprisingly downbeat  conclusion . main points of interest are two feeble decapitations   the omen  has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set  piece   and the love  making scenes featuring the doe  eyed but extremely kinky susan george . the first is a long  don  t look now  inspired piece with her hubby  complete with piano music the second a much shorter  probably at her insistence  entanglement with mcclure  both looking pretty uncomfortable . anyway  every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost .  br    br   overall i can  t decide whether  the house where evil dwells  is rubbish  watchable rubbish  or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way . if you  re not into the genre there is nothing here at all  but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort .  br    br   best scene  in any other film the big  black  tree  climbing  japanese  muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show . they are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene  where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup . on seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is        to be told beef and vegetable  before uttering the immortal line  ugh  there  s an awful face in my soup  . if this wasn  t enough the reply is  c  mon  eat your soup for daddy .  laurel  hardy rest in piece .
