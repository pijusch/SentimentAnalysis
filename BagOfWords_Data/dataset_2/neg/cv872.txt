how this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me . this is a terrible clich  ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done . it really surprises me that so many of these a list stars would agree to this unfunny film . what  s even worse is the fact that is made almost    million here in the states . it does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks  even if the film is terrible . i felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore  fest . billy crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions . whatever you do  don  t fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this .
