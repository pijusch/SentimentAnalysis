a story of amazing disinterest kills  the psychic  over and over again . the characters and plot are completely uninteresting  as is fulci  s mad camera work  which is usually a redeeming factor in his films   and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found . it  s padded out to an insufferable degree   by the end  you won  t be clamoring with excitement but stricken with boredom  and  like me  maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep  . jennifer o  neill  s performance deserves occupancy in a better movie . fulci gorehounds beware   there  s just not much going on in  the psychic .   br    br
