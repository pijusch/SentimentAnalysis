i watched this video at a friend  s house . i  m glad i did not waste money buying this one . the video cover has a scene from the     movie capricorn one . the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow  ups  most not related to manned flight . sibrel  s smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast . he edits in his own voice  over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say . the video curiously ends with a showing of the zapruder film . his claims about radiation  shielding  star photography  and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against nasa  the astronauts  or american in general . his science is bad  and so is this video .
