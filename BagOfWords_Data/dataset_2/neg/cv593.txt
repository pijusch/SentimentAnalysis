perhaps it  s because i am so in love with the william holden  kim novak version  or because i  m not a gen  x  er  but this was absolutely the worst remake i have ever seen . without the original  s soundtrack  it just seemed like another typical tv movie . . . yes  about as bland as kraft cheese .
