it  s      and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well  fans will be upset and certainly the       seats will be full  only less happy there are so many black players on the field  this made for tv super bowl movie is watchable . it  s not much more  but it  s really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance  for the time   probably most notably tom selleck . unfortunately any goodness selleck brings to the screen  is quickly trumped by  actors  like dick butkus .  br    br   it  s a silly story about super bowl betting . pj jackson is charged by  new york   read mafia  for ensuring the game ends for their favor  in this case a            bet . pj is innocent enough  and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there . but things seem to fall apart for him . another person  the unsuspected lainie  takes charge . for a while  the mystery of murders isn  t known for certain  but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that lainie is the new antagonist .  br    br   it  s a bad movie  but is watchable . the acting is decent  and the filming is ok . at least there weren  t any silly typical   s car chases  they have their place just not here  . just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and you  ll survive .  br    br        maybe a  .
