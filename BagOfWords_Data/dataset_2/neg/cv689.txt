in spite of having some exciting  and daring  sequences  nbtn just never gets going . there are exploding boats  hat pin murders  mass suicides  pathologists with body parts  and all sorts of classic mystery  horror scenes  but they  re interspersed with extended periods of pure exposition . everybody in the movie looks bored . this is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time this was filmed .  br    br   add to this the  too  proper  brit characters and you feel like you  ve drifted into a sherlock holmes movie .  br    br   finally  the cinematography is very ordinary . there are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside  or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge bonfire  but the whole thing is unimaginative and dull .  br    br   definitely only for lee and cushing fans .
