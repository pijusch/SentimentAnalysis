the soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb . the soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy . one by one  the blood is drained from those involved in the dig .  br    br   to be as brief as possible  pharaoh  s curse is quite the lackluster affair . while the movie does present a few good  original ideas  blood sucking mummy  s  soul transference  interesting make  up effects  the arm ripping scene  etc .  and a few atmospheric moments  the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding . to make matters even worse  the first   of the film  s relatively short   minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding . i usually go for these slow moving mummy movies  but pharaoh  s curse tests even my patients . the cast helps very little . with only one exception  ziva rodann is the lone bright spot  wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character   the cast is as dull as the screenplay . finally  i don  t know whose idea it was to put the mummy  looking servant in what appears to be pajamas  but it  s a laughable  ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audience .  br    br   despite my mostly negative comments on the pharaoh  s curse  i  m going to rate it a     . not a good rating to be sure  but generous given all the problems i have with the movie .
