i have just seen this film  and fallen in love with it . there is a little bit of something for everyone  and its a particular free for all when it comes to the romance between lachlan and lil . when they are on the beach  i nearly cried . . . there is the unspoken realization that time is the most precious commodity and it is most evident when they are together . this idea taken from several angles  from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional of places . the film almost makes you long for that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow could very well be your last . crowe was particularly wonderful in his role of lachlan . i  ve always had a soft spot for the accent  but i nearly melted with his portrayal of his character . the way this film was shot is also beautiful  with the music  backdrop of the open fields  and superb acting . all together  this is a wonderful film that tugs at all of human emotions .
