come on people . this movie is better than  . i can see this happening . . . wealthy people have done crazier things than this . and it was funny .  br    br   i watch a comedy to be entertained  escape from the pressures of the world for a short while  and not to have to take anything too seriously . this movie fully suits that purpose . i judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing saddles . i watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring  likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home . it will remain on my list of  favorite . . . . . must watch for the holiday season  . if you just want to have a fun   minutes  watch this one .
