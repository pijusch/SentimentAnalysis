it  s true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes . and none more so that september         a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism .  br    br   no  this documentary didn  t set out to be dwelling on the events leading to     . rather  the filmmakers  brothers gdon and jules naudet  set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie new york firefighter . they had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training  and had handpicked their  proby   probation firefighter  to join them in an ny firehouse  home to ladder  and engine  . but their production was to develop and contain at that time  believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the world trace center .  br    br   i was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of lan gaming  and received a call at about    pm local time from my dad  who informed me of the above . few minutes later  he told me there was another  and that the wtc was under attack . by the time i arrived home  the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke  and to my horror  they collapsed  under an hour .  br    br   the filmmakers had two cameras running that day  one who had followed a team out on a routine call  and which immediately raced to the wtc upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it . we follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of wtc  where the first responders of firefighters  paramedics  and police had to make sense of what happened  and to quickly develop a plan of action . the other camera  held by the other brother  was making his way to wtc to look for his sibling  and along the journey  captured the many expressions of new yorkers  as well as the sense of chaos in and around manhatten .  br    br   peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from ladder  and engine   which miraculously  did not suffer any casualty . but being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil  as they struggle to come to terms with the event . through the events that unfold  we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs  to save lives .  br    br   we began with what the documentary was supposed to be  before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus  right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures . it  s not a film that is fabricated  and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary  and heavens  not sound stages for hollywood blockbusters  . it  s as close as you can get to that day  witnessing the event up close  from safety .  br    br   code  dvd contains a separate extra hour of  sets of interviews with the men of ladder  and engine  .
