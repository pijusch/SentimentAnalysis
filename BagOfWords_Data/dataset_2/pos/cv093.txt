this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen . it shows a china i had never seen or imagined  and i believe it shows      s china in the most real light ever seen in a movie . it is absolutely heart  breaking in so many situations  seeing how hard life was for the characters  and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful . you truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film . the actors are all perfect  such that you feel like you have really entered a different world .  br    br   i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough . it may just change you forever once you have seen it .
