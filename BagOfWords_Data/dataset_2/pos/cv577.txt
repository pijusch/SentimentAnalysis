this is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the cameroon . the  sisters  in law are female lawyers and judges who in     successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a muslim council . it is rather long   about two hours   but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges . it will leave you  as it left me  with many questions about exactly how this change occurred . how and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the cameroon  have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses  was the granting of a divorce by a muslim court  against the express wishes of the husband  a one time event  i  m not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions . they made the movie two years ago  not yesterday . and the movie they made deserves a wide audience .
