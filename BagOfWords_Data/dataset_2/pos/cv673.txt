i just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable . it is a quiet  little film that doesn  t overwhelm you with special effects or  big  performances . it simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of north carolina .  br    br   henry thomas gives a good performance as raymond toker  a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods . toker  s search for the baby  s parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life . david srathairn plays truman lester  a slimy conman with an ulterior motive . and david plays the bad guy to perfection .  br    br   there is much more to this film than first meets the eye . filmed on location in north carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music  it is worth watching .
