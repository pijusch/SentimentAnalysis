having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised . reality check the original series wasn  t that good . i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy duke  s legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted . the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks  the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous to be evil and rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment . it  s amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series .  br    br   back to the movie . if you watch this film in it  s own right  not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series  then it  s not bad at all . the real star is of course the general lee . the car chases and stunts are excellent and that  s really what d . o . h . is all about . johnny knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with seann william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumb  and  dumber sort of way the tv series never achieved . the lovely jessica simpson is a natch as miss daisy  burt reynolds makes a much improved boss hog and m . c . gainey makes a believably nasty rosco p . coltrane  the way he always should have been .  br    br   if you don  t like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldn  t be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect . otherwise if you want an entertaining car  action movie with a few good laughs that  s not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind .
