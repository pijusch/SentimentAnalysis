made after quartet was  trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham . here the three stories are the verger  mr . know  it  all  and sanitorium . the first two are comic  the verger is like a prolonged joke  but one with a good pay  off   and the last more serious  as health issues are involved  . again the author introduces the film and the stories .  br    br   james hayter  soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick  is the hero in the verger . he holds this small custodial  type job in a church  but the new vicar  michael hordern  is an intellectual snob . when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him . hayter has saved some money  so he tells his wife  kathleen harrison  he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop . he has a good eye  and his store thrives . soon he has a whole chain of stores . when his grandchild is christened by hordern  the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex  verger . the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments . i  ll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting .  br    br   according to maugham he met a man like max kelada  nigel patrick  on a cruise . in mr . know  it  all kelada is a splashy  friendly  and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip  regarding jewelry  by steamship . his state  room mate is mr . grey  the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde  white  who is somewhat  silently disapproving of max . max likes to enliven things  and soon is heavily involved in the ship  s entertainment . at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non  maugham story and film china seas        as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake  after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real  . i won  t describe the way max rises to the occasion .  br    br   sanitorium is the longest segment . roland culver plays  ashenden   the fictional alter  ego of maugham  a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock  s the secret agent  . here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health . he finds a remarkable crew of people  including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman  finlay currie as an irascible scotsman  john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is  at war  with currie  raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up  and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness . culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions . the last  dealing with simmons and rennie  is ironic but deeply moving .  br    br   it was a dandy follow  up to the earlier quartet  and well worth watching .
