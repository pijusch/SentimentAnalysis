i  m on the opposite end of the previous comment .  br    br   first of all  i don  t think this was intended to be a straight sequel to  the jerk  . i mean  it  s not titled  the jerk   . . . it  s  the jerk  too   which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same  it actually revolves around a completely different person .  br    br   think about it virtually no connection to the previous movie  other than character names a totally different story different cast and the fact that it  s a partial musical .  br    br   i say give this movie some credit . it does have plenty of laughs in it . . mark blankfield at his prime .
