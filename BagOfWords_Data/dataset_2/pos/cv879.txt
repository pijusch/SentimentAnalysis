good show  very entertaining . good marshal arts acting . good story plot . the entire main crew did a nice job from robert urich  to chuck  norris  jennifer tung  and especially a big hand to judson mills . an especially fine tribute to robert urich  in his latter days . a great  actor who will be truly missed .
