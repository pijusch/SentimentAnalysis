an opium den  a dirty little boy  actually a midget   prostitutes galore  a violent fracas in a dive  a motel for sexual shenanigans  scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot  a boozer falling down the stairs  a racially mixed clientle in a bar with asians  africans  and anglos treated equally  does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall  wrong . these are all scenes from a     musical .  br    br   the first half of  footlight parade  is preparation for a musical extravaganza which occupies the last half of the film . chester kent  cagney  is about to lose his job and does lose his playgirl wife as a result of talking pictures squeezing out live stage musicals . his producers take him to see a popular talky of the day  john wayne in  the big trail .  before each showing of the flick  a dance number is presented as a prologue . shorts  news reels  serials  and cartoons would later serve the purpose . kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the dwindling live musical business . kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer busby berkeley . could it be that cagney  s character is patterned after berkeley  could be .  br    br   in preparation for the prologues  kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival . he uncovers the traitor  fires him  then unbeknown to him a new leak is planted in the form a dazzling temptress . his assistant  nan prescott  joan blondell  soon to be mrs . dick powell  has the hots for kent and is determined to expose the wiles of the temptress . a new singer from arkansas college shows up in the form of scotty blain  dick powell  who turns out to be a real find and is paired with bea thorn  ruby keeler  . the resulting three prologue musicals  which couldn  t possibly have been presented on any cinema stage of the day  are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were over seventy years ago   honeymoon hotel    by a waterfall   and  shanghai lil .   br    br   of special note is the song and dance of tough  guy james cagney . like fred astaire and bill  bojangles  robinson  cagney  s dancing appeared natural and unrehearsed  although hours went into practice to get each step just right . not as good a singer as astaire  cagney  s singing  like astaire  s  sounded natural  unlike the crooning so popular at the time . it  s amazing that one person could be so talented and so versatile as james cagney .  br    br   most critics prefer the  shanghai lil  segment over the other two . yet the kaleidoscopic choreography of  by a waterfall  is astonishing . how berkeley was able to film the underwater ballets and to create the human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated . the close up shots mixed brilliantly with distant angles is a must  see . the crisp black and white photography is much more artistic than it would have been if shot in color .  br    br   though not nearly as socially conscious as  gold diggers of        footlight parade  stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever put on the big screen .
