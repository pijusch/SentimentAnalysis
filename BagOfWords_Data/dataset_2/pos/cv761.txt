and i am a nicole kidman fanatic . i would pay to see and hear her read the moscow phone book  which  for all i know  she may have been doing when she was speaking russian in this movie .  br    br   all four of the principals are excellent  but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by nothing .  br    br   while one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie  this one asks too much of the viewer .  br    br   it could have been very funny  which it is in parts  or quite frightening  which it is in one scene  but the director didn  t seem to know which way to go .
