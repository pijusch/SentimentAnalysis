i just saw this at the toronto film festival  and i hope it gets wide release because i want to see it again  it is a character  driven film  and andrew and david are more than up to the task . any discussion of the plot might be  br    br   considered spoilers  so i  ll just say that the storyline is clever  the acting is superb  and the effects are amazing . well  filmed and well  paced too . one of the best films i have seen in ages  and very refreshing in this summer of dreary  br    br   movies . it had the audience laughing the whole time . see it if you can .  i particularly liked the  candy bar  candy bar   scene .
