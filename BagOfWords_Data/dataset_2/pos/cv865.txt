this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes  the money pit and are we done yet   only points out all the more how the    s movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since  regretfully  been lost .  br    br   i was   when i first saw this and even at that tender age  there was much i could laugh at . now of course being familiar with adult frustrations  i see a whole lot that i missed as a youth .  br    br   the three main actors . . . cary grant  myrna loy  and melvyn douglas . . . interacted perfectly  but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream . it  s never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions .  br    br   all in all  this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it .
