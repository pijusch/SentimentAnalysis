i found  still crazy  to be marvelously entertaining  and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late    s  early    s rock . my   year old daughter watches it with me every time i drag out the dvd  don  t worry  it  s only been three times  and she loves it too .  br    br   it is a truly loving  poignant and hilarious nod to the era  and every actor hits his  her notes with perfection . it was my first introduction to bill nighy and i am glad his somewhat similar turn in  love actually  brought him more attention . bruce robinson was incredible as brian  bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug  damaged rocker stereotype . it was interesting to see that robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer .  br    br   i live in sherman oaks  california  and after the first time i saw the movie i bumped into billy connolly at the local mall  he lived here at the time  and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time . he invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time . we even talked of the idea of an american  oriented remake before wisely dismissing that . why mess with the original   br    br   my only problem with  still crazy  is that it wasn  t hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience .
