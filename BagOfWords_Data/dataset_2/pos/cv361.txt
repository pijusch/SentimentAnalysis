i was brought up on doc savage  and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now  i found it thoroughly entertaining . i have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions  granted they mostly think i  m odd but there you are .  i don  t know what it is about the doc  but he always gets the girls  has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men . this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre  and was way before it  s time  it is not to be taken seriously  move over austin powers . ron ely is a god . it is unfortunate that this film hasn  t been released on dvd in the uk . i don  t think it should be remade and bastardised  like i said it  s a classic  it cannot be done without ron .  like the italian job without mini  s and michael caine  . i give it      .
