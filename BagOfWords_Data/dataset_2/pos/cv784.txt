this is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching . the story is engaging and it doesn  t take long before the chemistry between nicole kidman and ben chaplin grabs your attention . the acting is first class and the characters are represented well . sometimes it feels like the director couldn  t decide himself between drama and romantic comedy . ben chiller  s portrayal of the law abiding and shy englishman with porn s . m . magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs  as does the look in nicole kidman  s eyes when she is offering john his first taste of intimacy in a long time . . . other times the actors and especially nicole kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant .
