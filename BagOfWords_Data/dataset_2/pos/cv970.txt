  br    br   i must admit  i was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of  cut  last night  though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem . i am a true horror fan as true as they come  and found  cut  to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced  but one of the great parody  comedy films of late .  br    br   my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements  the film was not overly clever in it  s application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could . i am certain this was intended as humour . . . . hoping this was intended as humour .  br    br   and of course  there was the gore .  br    br   the use of the  customised  garden shears was brilliance  besides the expected stabs and slashes . in short  there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths  enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth .  br    br   the appearance of both kylie minogue  short that her appearance was  and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film  both performances were fantastic  as well as simon bossell   the castle   in a brilliant role as the jokey technician .  br    br   all in all  i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years  as well as a beautiful satire  parody  toungue  in  cheek till the very end .  br    br   loved it . go see it
