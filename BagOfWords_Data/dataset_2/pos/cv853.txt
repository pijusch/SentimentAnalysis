i love monte carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie . i thought everyone was very good . i was not familiar with richard lewis  i thought he made his character  julian peters  very personable  funny and attractive . sean young was very good as the befuddled rejected girl with a heart of gold . george hamilton was charming and the perfect italian gigolo . john candy has a field day as the bon vivant . james belushi is hysterical as a total jerk . cybill shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife . delightful ensemble cast . lots of talent  clever script  lots going on and beautiful locations . just a nice pick me up for a dreary day . especially in the winter when a trip to europe is not anywhere on your horizon .
