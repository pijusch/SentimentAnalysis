a light  hearted comedy  nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to a world of nothing . anything you don  t like  be it a stack of bills  a bad memory  or even hunger can disappear at your wish . they approached this movie very well  and with an enjoyable starring duo  there were only a few things i didn  t like about nothing  and they weren  t even part of the main movie .  br    br   first  the post  credits scene  and yes  there is one   good for a chuckle  but what were they trying to accomplish with that  i was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing . instead  we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream . it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion  and wasn  t really necessary  nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of frame .  br    br   second  the trailer i saw the trailer on the dvd  and like others have already said this  it promotes a horror movie that never came . oh well  poor marketing i guess .  br    br   if you see this at your movie rental store  take a look  because nothing is a great movie to watch . if you have a big screen though  you might want to wear shades .
