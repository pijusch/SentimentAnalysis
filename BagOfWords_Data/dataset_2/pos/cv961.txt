johnnie to  s election has some cool music on the opening creditsand a nice opening credits  design too  a kaleidoscope of chinese characters and those asian mobsters solemnly taking an oath or uttering some sacred stuff as a matter of fact the whole flick is nicely scored . i have found about to from bishop seraphim sigrist and was quite eager to see a to movie . the one with which i began  election  is exciting and interesting  and only moderately violent by nowadays standardsmoderately and also essentially violent the story of an asian godfather  s scheming  it uses a puzzle play of elements  violent facts from the mobsters  lives  the race for the scepter  true details  and as with coppola we are expected to believe that some of the morally glamorized mobsters are entitled and nice and likable . the performances are reasonably amusing and colorful .  br    br   election is well made in the enjoyable  somewhat careless style of the hong kong fare the ending is bitter  true  straight and will scare the kids .
