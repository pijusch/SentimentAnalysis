  radiofreccia  is still a good surprise in italian cinema . the film is based on a book of italian songwriter luciano ligabue  who also directs the movie and writes the music score  of course .  br    br   the film is a portrait of north italian province life  in the emilia romagna region . we  re in      the time of the first free radios  one of the boys of the movie creates  radioraptus  . youth wishes  friendship  love  sex  individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes  but the film speaks also about drugs  freccia  the main character  is a victim of heroin slavery .  br    br   without being boring and moralist  the story flows very well the spontaneity of actors is strong and the way of directing as well . obviously luciano  liga  ligabue is neither fellini nor a movie professional  first of all he  s a musician . but he succeeds in making a good product . unfortunately he  ll not repeat the success with his second movie  da zero a dieci   not good at all .  br    br   in  radiofreccia  actors are generally not very famous  the only star is stefano accorsi  one of the most popular young italian actors . see in a small role another italian songwriter  francesco guccini  he  s the nice communist barman and football trainer
