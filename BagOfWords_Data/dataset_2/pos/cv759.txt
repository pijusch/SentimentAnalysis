in watching this early demille work  it was once again reinforced to me that early demille is far superior to late demille . his attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable . his pacing is very good  enabling much to be told in the space of an hour or so . it is a pity that he wasn  t as intuitive about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films .  br    br   this was the first film in which i had seen cleo ridgely . she was remarkable  quite restrained and yet conveyed a broad spectrum of emotions .  br    br   the ending is wonderful .
