a classic cartoon  always enjoyable and funny . it has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters . road rovers is a show worth seeing  it is a short   episodes  and if you can ever manage a chance to see it  you should . unfortunately  it is very hard to find . i think warner brothers studios should release a dvd that contains all   episodes . i would definitely buy it if they did  and if they do  you should buy it too . if you have kids who like dogs  they will love road rovers  road rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired  it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was .
