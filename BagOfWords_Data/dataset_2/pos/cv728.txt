what a great barbara stanwyck film that i happened to see the other night .  jeopardy  was fantastic . it was made in     and probably for double bills but it kept me on the edge of my seat .  br    br   barbara stanwyck plays helen  who with husband doug  barry sullivan  and son  lee aaker  drive to an isolated fishing spot in mexico for a vacation . husband has a fall from the jetty and the only way he is to be saved is if barbara drives back to a garage for some rope .  br    br   while there she runs into a psychotic killer  ralph meeker  one of my favourites  and what follows is a game of cat and mouse as barbara tries everything in her power to get meeker to come back with her to free her husband .  br    br   the film was so suspenseful and such a surprise  i was not expecting such a great film . but i suppose i should have realized  is there anything barbara stanwyck does that is anything less than wonderful
