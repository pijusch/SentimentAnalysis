a friend of mine recommended this movie  citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl  the movie  s main character . i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more  i  m not very sure whether or not that  s flattering portrayal .  br    br   this is a pretty unique work  the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance  not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue  whale music is just so much more  well  relaxed .  but instead that they both represent modern love stories .  br    br   in general i  m a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians  for example i highly recommend hard core logo  and this film in particular . it has an innocent charm  des is not always the most likeably guy  but there  s something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy .
