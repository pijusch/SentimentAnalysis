i think dark angel is great  first season was excellent  and had a good plot . with max  jessica alba  as an escaped x    manticore creation  trying to adapt to a normal life  but still  saving the world  . and being hunted by manticore throughout the season which gives the series some extra spice .  br    br   the second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first . the plot kinda disappeared  and the series lost a little of it  s charm  mostly because of all the weird  creatures  appearing . don  t get me wrong the second season is good  but with a little bit to much of the  manticores  . however  they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season   in which i had a lot of hopes to see more of .  br    br   so i really wish they could start making new episodes . and with james cameron behind this it can  t go wrong . so as a conclusion i would say it  s a great series  however i  m still hoping for a third season
