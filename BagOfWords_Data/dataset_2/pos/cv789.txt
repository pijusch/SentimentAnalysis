i really have to disagree with guy  yardley  rees who  should he have watched the entire film  would have seen some absolutely stunning scottish scenery  some of the best ever shot in skye  and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant whole .  br    br   this is not a big budget film . rather it is a film that has a strong community feel .  br    br   i can  t say how much  standard  films bore me  pushing out the same polished stuff again and again . seachd doesn  t seem to be about that at all . it really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any recent scottish film .  br    br   ok  so the acting isn  t in the style a blockbuster . that  s because the actors are seemingly real people . i actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing  and at times unusually beautiful .  br    br   seachd really bears a second viewing  since there are many threads that become clearer second time around  that really do feed into the ending .  br    br   overall  the combination of music and  at times  stunning visuals  plus a community approach to the acting and non  normal structure has turned seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film . more of these please
