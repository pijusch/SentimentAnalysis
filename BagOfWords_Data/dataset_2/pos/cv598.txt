this is a good movie  but it is not recommended if you don  t like intelligent movies . it  s about two guys that wish that the world would go away  and that  s exactly what they get . the acting is great  the ending was not predictable  and it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days . people complain about the movie being too simple or too boring . i think they should just stick to movies like the toxic avenger  i actually like b movies  or the grim adventures of billy and mandy . one note if you notice this  this has exactly the same actors from cube except four actors . make it two notes wait after the credits  trust me on this one  . enjoy the movie .
