this film was seen by my wife and i when it came out in     . it was a revelation to us . we actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children . obviously we were wrong . love may come from where you don  t expect it and maybe don  t want it . but we both chose that love anyway .  br    br   and no  it never changed our sexual orientation . that kind of stuff is for the christian wackos .  br    br   when we were young we both had affairs  but never with the opposite sex . as we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs .  br    br   this story is not far fetched . however  the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me . my wife and i have been sleeping together for the last   years . we are still gay . end of story .
