i stumbled across this  act  i  by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago . this was  nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned . it amazed me . it intimidated me . it shocked me . i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later  i happened to think about it again . then went and bought both acts . they were even better than i had experienced at first .  br    br   my only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime  warranting tanks and heavy artillery  it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals . that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time . if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda  it certainly has not been shown as such .  br    br   i don  t think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this . but regarding the story  there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused .
