when i was little  my parents got this movie for me to watch . i really liked it  and i watched it over and over again . even when i was in  rd grade i still watched it from time to time . recently  i watched it again  just for the sake of nostalgia  and though the show was not aimed for my age group  i  m in my late teens   i still found it entertaining and educational . this show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others . some parts i found quite entertaining . also  this show does not have any bad content  so you can leave kids alone with this show and not worry about them picking up any bad language or whatnot . i would recommend this .
