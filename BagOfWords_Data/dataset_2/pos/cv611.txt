i watched this as part of my course at aberystwyth university and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the uk . well actually  it doesn  t  because this film is everything a hollywood film isn  t  original  creative  quirky and humorous . it seems that today no  one really wants to see this type of movie as  in the simplest terms  it doesn  t conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film .  br    br   i haven  t written a review for the imdb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention  even if it is during my   minute break between classes  essentially  it is about nothing  as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world . the brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise  en  scene consists of half a house and a vast white  empty space . this is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors  both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles .  br    br   i  d love to write some more but am on quite a time limit . however i encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try . a very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well  executed fashion  with the combination of good performances  a strong script  nice sound design and  fairly  impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie .  br    br   it  s just a shame so few people know about nothing . . . .
