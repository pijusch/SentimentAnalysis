narratives  whether written  visual or poetic epics  generally try to avoid too may characters readers and viewers  after all  can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who . this is especially true in film  i think  simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema . viewers like myself  however  don  t have that problem because we see all our films on dvd or vhs .  br    br   a year ago i was introduced to audrey tautou  a french actress  whom i first saw in the fabulous destiny of amelie poulain       and later in a very long engagement        both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters . this earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways more characters and more complexity .  br    br   now  other directors have used those techniques before robert altman with the player        short cuts        gosford park       and others paul thomas anderson did the same with magnolia       . stanley kramer did it with a mad  mad  mad  mad world in      a comedy of almost epic proportions . the difference with this film is  first the director lets us  see  inside the head of some of the characters and second  some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewer  s memory as the story flip  flops between different time periods .  br    br   the basic  the core  so to speak  story concerns a young woman  irene  tautou  who is told  by a fellow commuter on a train  that she will meet her true love on that day . this occurs in the first few minutes of the film . the clever irony at this point is that irene doesn  t realize that the young man opposite  gilbert robin  may be that  one true love  . and  nor does he . . .  br    br   they go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter . however  chaos results throughout the rest of the day  not only for the two young people  but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere  and yet . . .  br    br   if the story were simply that  it could tend to be boring  and even quite predictable . not so . the script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace  but which are turned into believable  extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again . for example  the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours  consider your alternatives two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before irene and her man of destiny meet again . or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen  consider again what would happen . . .  br    br   all of that is interesting enough . what was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was the one for irene  or whether it was  in fact  the young man on the train . that kept me guessing for a while .  br    br   i  ll let you think about that  should you see this delightful romp .  br    br   recommended for all .
