i get tired of my  and  year old daughters constantly being subjected to watch nickelodeon  disney and the like . it all seems to be the same old tired cartoons rehashed over and over again . when my daughters couldn  t go to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick  i wanted them to just relax and rest for a while . i flipped the tv on and in searching for something different  i flipped the channels . my finger stopped channel surfing the moment i heard harvey  s voice . i adore every single solitary thing this man has done and when i saw that he was doing voice  over work for a little duck . . . well  i couldn  t change the channel  my daughters were instantly mesmerized by the cartoon and the more we watched the show together  the more i grew to love it along with the message that was being portrayed . it  s not necessarily a proponent for  gay rights  but rather for anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child for anything . i had friends who were picked on for one thing or another . . . . too fat  too skinny  too feminine  being a bully  not being smart enough  only having one parent . . . . you name it  kids  as a rule  can be very very cruel to one another so i was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually conveyed a life message to its audience . my girls already accept others as they are and don  t pick on others for being different . my older daughter actually stands up for her friends if they  re picked on  one happens to have a single mom and that little girl is picked on quite often   it warms my heart when kassie stands up for her   .  br    br   so  those of you who are condemning this show because you feel that it  s an advocate for  gay rights  or are being forced to  accept certain views   you clearly and completely missed the point of this poignant little cartoon .  br    br   and if you need it explained to you . . . . well  you need more help than any television show could ever offer .
