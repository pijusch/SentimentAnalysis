i watched  elephant walk  for the first time in about   years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior  rebecca .  as others have said  you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor  only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a larger  than  life yet deeply flawed relative . you have the stern and disapproving servant  a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart  climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homestead .  br    br   meanwhile   elephant walk  also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to  the letter   the bette davis love triangle set on a singapore rubber plantation rather than a sri lankan tea plantation .  br    br   maltin gives  elephant walk  just two stars  and imdb readers aren  t much kinder  but i enjoyed it despite its predictability . elizabeth taylor never looked lovelier  and peter finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father . dana andrews   a favorite in  laura  and  the best year of our lives    is wasted as elizabeth  s frustrated admirer . the real star is the bungalow  one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history .
