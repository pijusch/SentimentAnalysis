the trailer for this movie didn  t do the movie justice . and while the movie didn  t know what it really wanted to get across  the first half of the movie being a light  romance comedy and the second have a more serious  romantic drama  the overall impact was much better than i thought it would be . this movie was more of a date movie  but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be . kidman  being one of my favorites  of course i  m biased  but this movie proved to be a light  sensitive  if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better . three out of four stars .       .
