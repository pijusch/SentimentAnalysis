popular radio storyteller gabriel no one  robin williams  scraggy and speaking in hushed  hypnotic tones  becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen  year  old boy from wisconsin named pete logand  rory culkin   who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents . to boot  pete has aids and this compels gabriel further still  since his partner jess  bobby cannavale  good  happens to be a survivor of hiv himself .  br    br   he also acquaints himself with pete  s guardian  a woman named donna  toni collette  brilliant   and when gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to wisconsin  he discovers some secrets he was  naturally  not prepared to find .  br    br   based on real events that happened to armistead maupin  who co  wrote the screenplay with terry anderson  and directed by patrick stetner  this film moves a lot faster    min .  maybe a few minutes longer  than one might think a movie of this genre would run . that  s good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear . it  s bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn  t sew  up any of the plot openings or back  story . i  d rather not go into any great detail except to say that  if you are not familiar with mr . maupin  s works or his personal story  you feel a little bit out of the loop here . still  the performances by williams  i would  ve loved to heard more of his narration  personally   collette  cannavale  culkin and much of the supporting cast  the waitress at the restaurant collete  s donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has   are top  notch and the mood established here   namely  the chilly  lonely dark exteriors of wisconsin and new york   give a terrific framing for this story . it may have ends that don  t tie together particularly well  but it  s still a compelling enough story to stick with .
