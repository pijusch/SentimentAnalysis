this is a beautiful  rich  and very well  executed film with a rich and meaningful story . basically  it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a  male  heir to carry on his craft  but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male  dominated world . the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and society  s traditional notions .  br    br   the story is fun  emotional  and complex . the exploration of the characters  their lives  and emotions  is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all . the film expertly conveys the old man  s emotions and his desire to find an heir  and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation . there is also humour  sometimes quite subtle  at appropriate points . the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture  creating further interest and depth to the film .  br    br   the directing  acting  and scenery are all outstanding . added to the other strengths  this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling  real characters . as a result  the film evokes strong empathy for  and feelings about  the characters .  br    br   some have claimed that the ending weakens the film  but i do not necessarily agree . perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending  but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small .
