i saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was  the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was . well that was because it isn  t supposed to be taken so seriously  basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job . . there seems to be another movie coming out like that too  umm . . . scary movie   well this is aussie  and original    jessica napier does a surperb performance and sarah kants has a definate bright future in acting  i hope to see more of them . molly ringwald was a good move  and kylie was an even better move . the impossible princess was queen of the screen   i recommend seeing this flick  as you  ll be guessing until the very end the connection with raffy  hilary and the movie that never got finished   years ago .
