spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love  and mom and dad can have fun watching as well . growing up in the    s i enjoyed this movie  it  s plot and all the actors . i recently purchased this movie on dvd so when i have kids of my own  they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as i did . the plot is fun  a group of kids  embark on a journey they never expected  when they were rocketed into space by a overachieving robot . they were in auh at first but when they realized they didn  t have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in . once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life .
