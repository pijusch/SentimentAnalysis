i spotted in the guide to films list for the santa barbara film festival  where i went when i was in hollywood  that this film was in screening . basically there is an election for the new chairman of the hong kong triads wo sing society coming up  so you can imagine how much violence that is going to occur during this . the struggle is between  candidates  lam lok  simon yam  and big d  tony leung ka fai  for control of the oldest and most powerful triad parts of the society . also starring louis koo as jimmy lee  nick cheung as jet  cheung siu fai as mr . so  lam suet as big head and lam ka tung as kun . there are some good realistic corruption themes and moments  just about enough action  apart from maybe when the cops get involved  but a sequel followed  so it  s a pretty worthwhile crime drama thriller . very good
