this movie was excellent . a sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes . this is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie . you have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way  doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions . this equals on big happy movie in the end . this movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be  so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets . you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture . the cinema  photography is excellent  in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers . bound to be in oscar contention for best foreign film .
