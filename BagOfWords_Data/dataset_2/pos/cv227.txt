although not the best anime i have ever seen but i enjoyed lady death .  br    br   i have never read the comic book and just saw this at the video store and decided to give it a chance .  br    br   the animation was ok  i got the sense of the    s anime from it which is what set it off for me . why everyone else hates that is beyond me .  br    br   character development was fine . i like how they brought the transition from hope to lady death around . for you who don  t like it  obviously wasn  t paying attention . lucifer tells you how it happens  and she used his words .  br    br   creamtor was a nice mentor  soldier for her . his dark bruiting style was perfect for this kind of movie .  br    br   i think everyone here who has bashed this needs to take another look at it and reconsider . cause everything people have bashed this can be said about everyones favorite anime vampire hunter d
