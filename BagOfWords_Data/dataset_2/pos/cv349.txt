this one and  her pilgrim soul  are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone . as i mentioned in my comment on the new series  there  s something lacking in this new series . maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned . it  s a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serling  s version . however  this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too . i think the appeal is that no matter what they do  the lovers can never unite . i remember i wasn  t surprised by the korean movie  il mare   later remade into  the lake house  . i think it  s because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film .
