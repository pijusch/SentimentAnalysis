wow   br    br   this film is the best living testament  i think  of what happened on        in nyc  compared to anything shown by the major media outlets .  br    br   those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside . this film shows you what happened on the inside .  br    br   it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman  waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight . the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers . you are then given a front  row seat as firefighters rush to the scene  into the lobby of tower one .  br    br   in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane  and tower two  s subsequent fall  you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby . it is a sight you will not soon forget .  br    br   heart  rending  tear  jerking  and very compelling from the first minute to the last        deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made .  br    br   we must never forget .  br    br
