i watched the movie in a preview and i really loved it . the cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious . another highlight of the movie is definitely the music  which hopefully will be released soon . i recommend it to everyone who likes the british humour and especially to all musicians . go and see . it  s great .
