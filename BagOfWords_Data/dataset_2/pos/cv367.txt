this is actually a trilogy of  of somerset maugham  s short tales . the first one is the verger  which is about   minutes long and very enjoyable . after   years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can  t read nor write . so what does he do  opens a tobacco shop  of course   br    br   the second is mr . know  all which was actually a story i had read for school  years ago and instantly forgotten  until i heard the familiar introduction . another   minute one  and also very good . it worked better on film than in a book for me  but then perhaps that  s because i was only   the last time  afterall .  br    br   the  rd one is nearly a let  down . almost an hour in length  it simply drags . it  s not all that bad  but not as quick and snappy as the last  . i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour  and found that it still made sense and really i hadn  t missed a thing   br    br   overall i give them     and  out of    respectively .
