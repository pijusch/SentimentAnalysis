you know how star trek fans flocked to all the star trek movies  even the really bad ones  why  to see their heroes in action one more time . that  s the way i feel about doc savage . i am a major fanatic for the character  and the prospect of seeing doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming . and the first   minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation . then they decided to crib elements from a number of doc adventures and throw them into this one movie  resulting in a somewhat disjointed film . there  s a lot of promise in here  diluted by a number of unfortunate choices  the music  the  camp  elements  etc .  but the spirit of doc is there  and that  s what those of us familiar with doc and his crew respond to . so  in my long  winded way  what i  m trying to say is that this is not a bad movie it  s just not as good as it should have been . and anyone who is a fan of superman  james bond  indiana jones  buckaroo banzai  and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all .
