i didn  t really know what to expect when going out to watch the film  apart from the slightly surreal basic plotline that a lonely man orders a russian bride over the internet . that and it had nicole kidman in it . i absolutely loved the film though  and came out thinking  wow  .  br    br   refreshingly down to earth  the film moves along nicely  with a few suprises at each corner . the relationships in the film are believeable  with nicole and chaplin working against each other beautifully . the humour is subtle  with some great  office   like scenes at the bank  and the thriller element add tension without being hollywood .  br    br   overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation . it  s less about heroics and more about delicate relationships . brit  filmmaking at its best . . .  br    br
