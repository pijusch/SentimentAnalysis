  cut  is a full  tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do . most of the standard slasher cliches are there the old creepy house  the woods  the anonymous indestructible serial killer  buckets of gore  and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they  re having sex  that  s hardly a spoiler  .  br    br   the set  up is simplicity itself film  school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher  masterpiece   unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast . this also neatly  okay  messily  disposes of kylie minogue in the first reel . they are joined by one of the survivors of the original film  played by molly ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines . the rest of the cast fit their roles well  especially the lovely jessica napier  who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her .  br    br   there are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments  and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace . it also has an appropriate low budget look  including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate . good soundtrack  too . if there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send  up of or a homage to the slasher genre . probably a bit of both .
