me and my sister use to rent this every time we got movies and our parents would get so mad at so  but they let us anyways  and i love it . . . i can  t find anyone that lives near me that knows what i am talking about . . . i  m glad to see that i  m not the only one that loved this movie . . . i wish i could find this on dvd somewhere   i would love to watch this now just bc i loved it so much as a little kid . . . and i  m   now    i remember so much about it . . . thats where i got the little bunny fufu song from and all my friends know the song but not the movie   i think the little girl got there by sliding down the slide on her little playground thing
