man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word . the comedy concerns a character called robin tripp  played by the great richard o  sullivan  who finds himself after a wild party  ending up at the home of two ladies called jo and chrissy . ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate . the obvious ends up happening as he moves in .  br    br   man about the house was a pre  cursor to cooke and mortimer  s spin off show george and mildred which featured the  characters who were landlords to jo  chrissy and robin . these two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with mildred  the late and much missed yootha joyce  in particular getting some of the best lines of the series . a semi  regular character was larry  doug fisher  a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something  and never to return it  .  br    br   the american  s did a version called three  s company but it doesn  t stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original . thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with  women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around   million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script . what a pity modern comedy can  t reach that high standard .  br    br   this programme is available on network dvd
