i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy  i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business . . . who are now still trying to become adults . . . . no more fans  groupies  money etc . . . and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life . . . as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight . . . it is almost like they have to begin anew . . . this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the    s and    s are going through now . . . . and that  s where i find the film sad and depressing . but it portrays the life of an old rock star  abandoned and lost  in a believable way . the young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of hollis maclaren  outrageous  . . . and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for . this film is a must have for folks in their    s who have seen the rise and fall of bands  people who knew the members  and have watched them hurt as age creeps in  and popularity fades . this is an almost perfect movie . . . . sad but in a way positive . . . . because of the whales . a must see
