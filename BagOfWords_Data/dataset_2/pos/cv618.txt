just saw this at the     vancouver international film festival and it was funny as hell and a bit surreal . takes place in toronto  where these two losers live in this run  down house in the middle of a freeway system . david hewlett  pin  cube  cypher  and andrew miller  cube  are just great as the two losers who wish the world would just go away . the acting  dialogue and writing are very good  and the whole film looks great for such a low  budget flick . director  writer vincenzo natali was in attendance at this screening  and he seemed so intelligent and down  to  earth . this guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well within small budgets  it puts big budget hollywood crap to shame
