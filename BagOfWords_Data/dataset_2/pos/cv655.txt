this series was a cut above the rest of the tv detective series of the day but somehow didn  t find an audience .  br    br   the idea of a blind detective may not be totally new but added so much to the story . and who could forget pax  the beautiful guide dog in the series   br    br   whilst the stories themselves may have been no better than the average series  the settings  in new orleans  the acting and the music  i note the comment about the music score in other comments . . . i remember that clearly  all work to make a good television series even better   br    br   well you never know . . . one day paramount might just dig into its archives and release it on dvd
