say what you will about schmaltz . one beauty of this film is that it is not pro  american . it is a morality about some americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion . it is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose .  br    br   to me  the most interesting part of the film is the education of fanny and david farrelly  bette davis  mother and brother  . as fanny says   we  ve been shaken out of the magnolias .   br    br   in today  s political climate where  led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used     to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings  we sunk to the level of the     murderers to seek blood  thirsty vengeance . it can  t all be blamed on mr . bush  after all  we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re  elected him after his lies had been exposed . now  with complete justification  we americans are reviled throughout the world .  br    br   today  we watch this film with a new awareness that the rise to power of nazis in germany was not due to a flaw in the german character  but  a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts . i  m not comparing george bush to adolph hitler . but  i am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror  hatred  and hyper  nationalism to do despicable things .  br    br   sadly  the blackmailer  who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement  no matter how immoral  is most like the leaders of our country  those who support them  and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand  that they can  t even be bothered to vote .  br    br   a film like watch on the rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be  a force for the betterment of humanity  and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals .  br    br   geoff
