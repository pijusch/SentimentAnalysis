this movie is as unique as it is overlooked . . . . . . a different story is just that  it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain  one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind . i first saw this on cable in the late    s and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time . i believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life . it is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family . this film should be available on dvd  vhs so that not only the extra ordinary performances of meg foster  perry king can be acknowledged  but to show how far we have come  still have to go where relationships are concerned .
