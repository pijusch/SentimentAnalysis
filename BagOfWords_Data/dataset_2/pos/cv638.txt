fast  paced  funny  sexy  and spectacular . cagney is always terrific . blondel charms you with her wit and energy . it  s obvious that this is a pre  censorship film by the innuendo in the script  the costumes  and the way they touch each other . and bikinis before there were bikinis  this is no holds barred fun for everyone . i don  t understand the john garfield issue though . does it matter whether or not he  s in this film  if he is  he screen is so short that he  s basically a prop . you need to watch it frame by frame to even find him if he  s there . i  m a big cagney fan  but had never seen this one before . i found it on turner classics . i found it by wonderful accident . sit back and enjoy the ride
