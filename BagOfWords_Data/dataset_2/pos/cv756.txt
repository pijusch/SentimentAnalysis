while the british produced some hilarious and slick sitcoms in the     s  ab fab  men behaving badly  one foot in the grave  etc .  the   s were the real golden age .  br    br   in the     s there were whole new territories to explore  including the sexual revolution  feminism  and the slowly evolving awareness of a need for  sensitivity  that would  twenty years later  become political correctness . attempts to grapple with the confusion of this thoroughly modern world were the subtle and not  so  subtle themes in everything from the skits of monty python  s flying circus to sitcoms like man about the house .  by the late   s this  grappling  resulted in more meditative and bitter  sweet sitcoms such as the masterpiece butterflies .   br    br   man about the house is a perfect example of the good britcoms of the time  slightly genteel  cheeky  fresh  ingenuous  sometimes outrageous  with some well made observations on contemporary life . compare it to a cynical   s show such as ab fab  and it is hard to believe the two were created in the same country .  br    br   man about the house is one of the great britcoms of the   s  right up there with good neighbors  the good life   and about the house  s spin off george and mildred . its quality is attested to by the fact that  as with good neighbors  its creators  writers  and many of its cast have had continued success in british television .
