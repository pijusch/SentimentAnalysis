i  m not great at writing reviews  so i  ll just spout my opinions . . .  br    br   i loved this series at first . the adventure  the action  the comedy  the drama . . . i thought it was all brilliant . anderson  tapping  shanks  judge  davis . . . i loved them all . davis  it seemed  was the fifth  most important person in the cast . not a big deal . but when his character  general hammond  left at the end of the seventh season  and anderson  s character  colonel o  neill  moved from the field to the office  the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff . i don  t know whether it  s because hammond was more important that i realized or what  but for some reason  after the seventh season  the series turned to  .  br    br   the first seven seasons  though  were awesome . the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it  but it turned out to be  even if this wasn  t the original intention  a brilliant setup to the series . i recommend that you watch the movie first  then watch the first season of the tv series  then watch the movie again  you  ll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around  believe me   and then watch the rest of the tv series .  br    br   the last three seasons of the series aren  t nearly as good as the first seven  but that doesn  t mean they aren  t good . it just means they  re a letdown if you  ve gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons .  br    br   after you have finished this series  be sure to watch the spin off series  stargate atlantis . it is a worthy successor to this brilliant series .  br    br   edit on         i just found out that don s . davis died a few weeks ago . it is a great loss .
