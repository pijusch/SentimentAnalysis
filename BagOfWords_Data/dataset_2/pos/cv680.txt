it  s cheesy  it  s creepy  it  s gross  but that  s what makes it so much fun . it  s got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable . this movie is great to make fun of . rent it for a good laugh .  br    br   the film centers around three women newscasters  during a time way before cellphones . they go to a small town to cover a festival  but they can  t get a room to stay the night . and that  s when they meet ernest keller . he  s creepy in a psycho kind of way . and he offers to let them stay at his home . but he doesn  t tell them the truth about who lives there .  br    br   stephen furst  s performance is so amazing as  the unseen   that he really carries this film . most of the movie is kind of dull  although finding out the truth of ernest  s family is kind of interesting .  br    br   just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look . barbara bach and doug barr make nice eye candy .  br    br   i consider the movie an old gem  hard to find and worth a look .
