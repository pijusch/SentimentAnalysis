i always thought this would be a long and boring talking  heads flick full of static interior takes  dude  i was wrong .  election  is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller  drama  taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triads  rituals . characters are constantly on the move  and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider  it  s still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters . furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light  shadow contrasts . although there  s hardly any action  the ending is still shocking in it  s ruthless depicting of brutality . cool movie that deserves more attention  and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit .
