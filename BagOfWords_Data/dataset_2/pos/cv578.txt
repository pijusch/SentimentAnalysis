i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels well  this transposition is simply accurate  intelligent  delicate  careful  tactful  respectful  intense  in a word  perfect   br    br    emma  is one of austen  s most delightful and funny novels  thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters . the movie respected this subtle irony  not disregarding the comic element  miss bates above all  . what engaged me in the novel  and the movie renders it clearly  is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist  and the modern look with which women  men  and their relation are handled  and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the   th century  who lived almost a secluded life  could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did that most and still fascinates me . we can feel this modernity throughout the movie just replace costumes  and use a more current language but the situations  the feelings  the ideas would be extremely modern . i think of the morbid interest in other people  s lives  or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women  s relations  and still the difficulty in revealing  and giving expression to one  s feelings  especially love every situation gets a universal and out  of  time value .  br    br   the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role  nowadays she would be probably too mature for it   toni colette is simply great . and how i envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear  and then  the breathtaking english countryside  where every situation gets such a magic and dream  like dimension . . . a really enjoyable and deserving movie .
