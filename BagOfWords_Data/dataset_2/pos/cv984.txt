a horror movie is being shot and things aren  t going well . it  s about a masked killer . the director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew . he goes crazy and kills two people . he  s killed himself and the film is never finished . twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish it   but there  s a curse . people who try and finish it are killed themselves . the students ignore that . guess what happens next   br    br   the plot is old hat but this isn  t bad . . . for what it is  a low budget slasher film  . it  s well  made with a young and fairly talented young cast . no one is great but no one is terrible either . it also avoids the obligatory  and needless  female nude scenes . it moves quickly  the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesn  t insult your intelligence . also molly ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actress .  br    br   no great shakes but not bad at all . i give it a  .
