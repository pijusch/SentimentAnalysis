i bought dark angel seasons    two weeks ago  after catching a couple of season  episodes on channel  . nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is . i haven  t enjoyed anything as much since firefly  also and amazing show  . i  ll admit season  wqasn  t quite as good  but there are still some amazing episodes  see designate this  bag  em  the berrisford agenda  harbor lights  freak nation etc .  and alec is great . i  ve heard some of the plans for the would  be season   and i have to say  i can  t believe it was cancelled  i won  t spoil it for you  but it would have rocked  i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie  although at the moment it seems highly unlikely  . as proof of my obsessiveness  max  s barcode number is              and in the two weeks i  ve had it  i am  episodes away from having watched both seasons twice . it  s just too good .
