  happenstance  is the most new york  feeling parisian film i  ve seen since  when the cat  s away  chacun cherche son chat  .   br    br   a film from last year released now to capitalize on the attention audrey tatou is getting for  amelie   its french title is more apt  le battement d  ailes du papillon  the beating of the butterfly  s wings   as in summarizing chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives .  br    br   tatou  s gamine  ness is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures  and because she  s part of a large  multi  ethnic ensemble  so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters  especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me  and some of the characters fantasize what they should do such that i wasn  t sure if they were doing that or not .  br    br   but i loved how urban the coincidences were  from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around cafs .  br    br   the subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once .  br    br    originally written
