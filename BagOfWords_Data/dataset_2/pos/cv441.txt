although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special .  br    br   if you  ve never seen this film before you  ll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers . i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disney  s aladdin cribbed from the film . they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers .  br    br   i  ve given the film an  out of   instead of a   out of ten  which is where a good portion of this film dwells  because in the final   minutes the film falls apart in the pacing . everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end . from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting . it doesn  t kill the film  but it does weaken it .  br    br   still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale  or even a great movie .
