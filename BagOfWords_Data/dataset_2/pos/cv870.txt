though not in the whole film  andy griffith again plays his role best in this cbs tv  movie . the plot is easy  griffith  s character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named  mountains somewhere  . though it will never be seen on tv and never be released on video  if you do get the chance to watch this   take it .
