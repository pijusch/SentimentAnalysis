the road rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the master to fight crime around the world . the show was hilarious to say the least . simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages . running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game . the action was mesmerizing  and cleverly set up . the characters were very original  each with a very different personality . but what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters . each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed  but implied in subtext . hopefully  one day  there  ll be some way to watch the rovers in action again .
