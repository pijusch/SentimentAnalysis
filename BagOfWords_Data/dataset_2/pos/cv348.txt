china o  brien       was an attempt to make cynthia rothrock a star in the united states . this golden harvet production was helmed by veteran director robert clouse . sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or he  s lost his touch because he  s not that great of a director . the only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of ms . rothrock and richard norton . if this movie was directed by corey yuen or hoi meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight  to  video action flick .  br    br   china o  brien returns home to help out her dad . he  s having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help . so she returns home and restores order  with the help of two unlikely people  . but will they be enough to topple mister big and his evil cronies   br    br   if you  re a big cynthia rothrock fan then this movie  s catered for you . i only enjoyed the fighting scenes  everything else is rubbish . why didn  t raymond chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director   br    br   recommended .
