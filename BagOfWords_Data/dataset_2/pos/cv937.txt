this reminded me of spinal tap  on a more serious level . it  s the story of a band doing a reunion tour  but things are not harmonious between them . i was especially impressed with the performance of bill nighy as ray . you felt sorry for him  yet he had a certain creepiness about him . it  s a great movie to watch if you have ever seen your favorite band get wrinkly  old and pathetic . bittersweet  highly recommended . .
