i first discovered alexander korda  s       fantasy  the thief of bagdad in the early      s on a re  issue billed as  the wonder show of the century   both korda technicolor films  the thief of bagdad and jungle book were shown on one never to be forgotten program . the music of miklos rozsa enhanced both films . the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful  the thief of bagdad has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made . as the years passed  it became more difficult to enjoy the film  s color in the way it had originally been presented in . true technicolor gave way to a eastman color process in the middle      s . both kino and samuel goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video . but the eastman color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original technicolor . the laser disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it   nice  but not as it should be . now comes the m  g  m dvd   dec      issue . the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd that is nothing short of stunning    it was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the dvd once  i watched it a second time . the only  extras  are a spanish dubbed version  sub  titles in both english  spanish  and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer . thank you m  g  m for this exceptional dvd release . now  one can only hope that korda  s four feathers and a restored version of korda  s jungle book  to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation  will soon follow on dvd .
