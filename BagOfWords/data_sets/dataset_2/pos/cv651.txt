this movie is not schlock  despite the lo fi production and its link to troma productions . a dark fable for adults . exploitation is a theme of sugar cookies  and one wonders if the cast has not fallen prey to said theme . a weird movie with enticing visuals shadows and contrast are prominent . definitely worth a look  especially from fans of warhol and stylish decadence . through all the cruelty and wickedness  a moral  albeit twisted  can be gleamed .
