this movie is banned in just about every foreign country i can think of . the japanese people    who star in this must have been really desperate for a job  or we  re just friends . here  s the scoop  br    br   three thugs torture the hell out of a helpless woman  they use all kinds of things to eventually kill her  they burn her  kick her  spin here around in a chair  over    times    they use sound torture  by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over   hours  it don  t sound that bad at all  but it can make you go nuts  . they throw guts  probably from an animal  at her while shes knocked out  and she freaks when she wakes up . and who can forget the grande finale the greatest eyeball torture i have ever seen   br    br   if you have not heard of these films  and watch one without knowing that it is a simulated snuff film  you will think it is   just ask charlie sheen  this is guaranteed to freak people out and make some sick  like i said pure underground . check it out if you are a fan of underground horror  or foreign gore . if your not i highly recommend you read  up on the series before watching  from the gore  shock  and creativity aspect it gets a    but from the storyline and all that stuff it is a  . an underground classic . . .  br    br   my final rating is a      br    br
