i commend pictures that try something different . many films just seem like re  treads of old ideas  so that is the big reason i so strongly recommend passport to pimlico .  br    br   the movie is set just after ww  and the post  war shortages and rationing seem to be driving londoners  barmy  . the film centers on a tiny neighborhood in london called pimlico . they  too  are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it . that is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago  with this document  they reason  they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live life just as they want  since it turns out they really aren  t british subjects  where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something you  ll need to see for yourselves . leave it up the brilliant minds of ealing studios to come up with this gem
