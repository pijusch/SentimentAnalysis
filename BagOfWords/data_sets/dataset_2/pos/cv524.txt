anyone who loves the rheostatics  music is going to enjoy this film . i have some minor complaints  mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors  not maury  who aren  t really convincing in their roles  but i don  t have time write a detailed review . i just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented cbc television in canada the version that airs are the cbc is like the reader  s digest version of whale music    don  t watch it . it cuts out entire scenes and subplots  if you can them that  from the film . the cbc  which presents most of films untouched  took half the guts out of whale music . i don  t know why . it  s horrible what they did to the film . rent the video or watch it in a theatre  but don  t watch it on cbc television .
