i work at a movie store  and as such  i am always on the look  out for an excellent movie . i decided to check out nothing as it sat in our canadian section  and i  ve been trying to support my country  s movie industry . i was in for a surprise . the film features david hewlett and andrew miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationships . . . without working that hard . it is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters  as well as some funny exchanges   we can  t be dead  we have cable    . what more can i say without noting that it is worth a shot  even if you abandon it within the first half an hour .
