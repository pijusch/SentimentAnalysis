as we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known . the two leads always have to get together . late in the third act i was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together . a clue was given right from the start  but you  ll never realize it until the end . it  s a simple hook  but it works . it had to be you cover a lot of the usual ground  but takes a fresh spin when ever possible . i liked all the ny characters and i loved the locations . it  s a postcard of ny . also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it . so  if you like a good old fashion romantic movie . . . then this is for you .
