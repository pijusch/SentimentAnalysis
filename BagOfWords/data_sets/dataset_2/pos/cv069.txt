wow . what a wonderful film . the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by minglun wei  i hope he has more stories in him .  br    br   the acting is sublime . renying zhou as doggie was amazing   very natural talent  and xu zhu was a delight  very believable as the jaded old traditionalist .  br    br   the soundtrack was very effective  guiding without being overwhelming .  br    br   if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong kong  a family friendly  well acted  well written  well directed  near perfect gem .
