i  ve been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too . some of the users are stuck in a  realist  type of mentality . this film was meant to be a  fantasy  . . . . a  what if  fun film . it was never meant to be  real  or serious . it was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone i knew when it came out  even though it shadowed the tragedy of the challenger explosion . . . i was   at the time and totally enjoyed this one  my young son loved it too  later  i shared it with my daughter and she  too  loved it . spacecamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that  fun . all the  realists  in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film . so sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real spacecamp  one in alabama and one at vandenberg afb in california   they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt  letdown  . . . i guess their parents didn  t explain the difference between fantasy and reality . oh well . if you love fantasy  fun films and haven  t seen this one  i highly recommend it  enjoy
