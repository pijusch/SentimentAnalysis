i rented this movie this past weekend  cranked up the surround sound system  and got some great sound from special affects . this movie is a great movie rental  the special affects where enough to scare my fiance  but i noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated . i didn  t go to the movies and see this  but its a scary late night don  t feel like going out movie . i would recommend it
