to me  this review may contain spoilers  but i like watching movies with no idea of what is going to happen  so therefore i think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers   br    br   i just watched this movie again  and i must reiterate that it has the best ending to any movie . ever . ever . ever . the real translation   the beating of the butterfly  s wings   is oddly not used as the translated title . i suppose they thought most americans wouldn  t know what chaos theory is  except for those who saw or read  jurassic park   . the movie is based on chaos theory  and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events  which all lead back to one event . the movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect  as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters  about     . in a way  the ending seems inevitable despite this  but if you think about it  it is a perfect ending . think to yourself   what else needed to be said   it is at the same time a very brave ending . too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one  but an ending like this would never come out of hollywood .  br    br
