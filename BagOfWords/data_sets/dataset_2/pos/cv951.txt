johny to makes here one of his best style exercises  making a strong film with a good yakuza  s story . the election of the new yakuza  s boss is the beginning of a war inside the organization .  br    br   in my opinion the violence is wise used in the context  making a very strong gangs film . i specially love the way he tells the history  moving around all the roles inside the yakuza  s family  and making that we see the violence  like the only way they have to solve their problems . . .  br    br   talking about  the technical aspects  the film is a good example of paused  rythmic and planified way of shooting a film . one of the hong kong films of the year . is like infernal affairs  but without the easy action  violence scenes  and the confused storyline . strongly recommended to all asian films lovers .  br    br    sorry for my english  better do in spanish lol
