i wouldn  t call  we  re back  a dinosaur  s story  simply a kiddie version of  jurassic park  . i found it more interesting than that . like the former  it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours . but it really opens my eyes when i see who provided the voices john goodman  rhea perlman  jay leno  walter cronkite  julia child  kenneth mars  yeardley smith  martin short and larry king . to paraphrase that a given actor  the  cheers  woman  the  tonight show  host  the most trusted name in news  a famous chef  the  young frankenstein  police chief  lisa simpson  one of the three amigos and the cnn guy .  br    br   but i guess that i shouldn  t focus only on the cast . i thought that this movie had something for both children  purely fun  and adults  natural history  . true  it  s escapism  but the perceptive kind . i would actually say that john goodman doing rex  s voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in  monsters inc  . worth seeing .
