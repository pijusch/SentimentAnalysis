now either you like mr carrey  s humour or you don  t . me  myself and irene had audiences both walking out in droves and  on the other hand  cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth . bruce almighty is a bit more mainstream  but you have been warned .  br    br   if you  re not sure  watch the trailer . i saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when i saw the film . if you don  t find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny  don  t bother with the movie .  br    br   carrey  a reporter stuck in a rut covering  lighter news  berates god when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot . god takes up the challenge and asks carrey if he can do better . carrey gets into the swing of having all of god  s powers by making his girlfriend  jennifer aniston   s breasts bigger  getting himself promoted  and answering everyone  s prayers by single stroke computer commands .  br    br   this is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable  but it is very well made within it  s very limited intent  provides almost continuous laughs to carrey fans  and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow  minded god  squadders and anti  god  squadders .  br    br   on the more thoughtful level  the film tempts us to speculate about carrey  s own career  stuck in his  comedy  typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two golden globes . his most accomplished  straight  role  the man on the moon  is less well known that his comedy romps  or the truman show  on which the academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing carrey  .
