for a film that got little publicity  and few people have heard about  this was pretty good . it  s another one of these modern  day british crime films that are quirky   snatch    sexy beast   etc .  . it  s not wild like  snatch  but it  s interesting and it has some rough characters .  br    br   it also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show  not late  has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first  time viewer . basically  it  s about a low  key british male who sends away for a russian  mail order bride  who winds up  with the aid of two russian male friends  providing a couple of big surprises .  br    br   ben chapin and nicole kidman co  star  and are very good as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as kidman  s russian cohorts . this is a different kind of film and well  acted . kidman once again proves she  s far more than just a beautiful face .
