you can survive surviving christmas . i thought the television version was a bit edited way down . i like ben afleck . he plays drew johnson  a family  less adult  who is willing to pay complete strangers . the valcos starring james gandolfini and catherine o  hara as the parents and christina applegate as lisa valco  the daughter . drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn  t have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars . bill macy who i best remember for playing maude  s husband arthur is hired to play duda  the grandfather . when the whole situation comes crashing down  the truth can be painful . the valcos household is crumbling apart from the drew situation . drew  s rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit . you can  t buy what you wish for  the acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene .
