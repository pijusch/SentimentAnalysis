a slight  charming little movie to be sure  but a superbly  crafted one . gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent  and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue . this came out around the time of sense and sensibility  and i  m sure i don  t know why that one garnered all the oscar attention . emma is jane austen  s most accessible and least stuffy story  told well .
