i love this show   br    br   every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is . i am a huge sci  fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science  fiction   show in the history of film  tv . there are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion . its amazing  season after season the show gets better and better .  br    br   i  ve been a fan of macgyver since i was     now  and i find it so ironic that my  favorite tv shows of all time star richard dean anderson . its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other .  br    br   back when i first saw stargate the movie  i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci  fi flicks  then hearing a tv show would spin from it i got really excited  but didn  t get showtime till the fifth season was almost over .  br    br   though  i  m disappointed to hear that roland emmerich and dean devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead .  br    br   id say though that it turned out just fine . maybe even better .  br    br   this show is amazing  and i hope it never dies . atlantis here we come
