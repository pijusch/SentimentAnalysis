i love this film . it  s one of those i can watch again and again . it is acted well by a good cast that doesn  t try too hard to be star studded .  br    br   the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller . either would have killed the film completely .  br    br   the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel  good factor throughout .  br    br   it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes . . .  no that  s not a spoiler
