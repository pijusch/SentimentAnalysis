i totally agree that  nothing  is a fantastic film  i  ve not laughed so much when watching a film for ages  and david hewlett and andrew miller are fantastic in this  they really work well together  this film may not appeal to some people  i can  t really say why without spoiling it   but each to their own  i loved it and highly recommend it   br    br   the directing is great and some of the shots are very clever . it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it   br    br   although there are really only main  characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch .
