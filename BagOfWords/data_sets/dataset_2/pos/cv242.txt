we have to remember that the    s were practically a blank slate when it came to movies . hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies  noir  two reel oaters  etc to movies with a message . we had blackboard jungle  on the waterfront and so on . some folks might think that was an improvement . i don  t . who was the mogul who said if you want to send a message  call western union  he was right . these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy .  br    br   this one is a pip . it  s about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father  s estate . one of them  maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay . he  s initially in it for the bucks  but eventually falls for her . meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance . the results are predictable . you get a little bit of everything in this movie . sexual tension between the sisters . a little subtle masochism . hereditary insanity  if there is such a thing . we never get to meet the parents  but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown . one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar . the acting is so bad it  s hard to believe . it was released under the united artists umbrella by a company called bel  air productions . it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without permits . the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke . it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene .  br    br   i can  t explain it  not even to myself  but i gave this pile of trash an     . i  m familiar with the term  it  s so bad it  s good   but i don  t think i ever ran into the phenomenon before . well  maybe  hot rods to hell   but this one certainly fits . you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebody  s basement .
