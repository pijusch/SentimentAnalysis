i just saw this movie today with my children  son    and daughter   .   at the  rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival . after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director  tian  ming wu . he  through a translator  told several stories about his life and the making of the film .  br    br   all tangents aside  both of my children really enjoyed this movie . of course  i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter  but much of the film is visually self  explanatory .  br    br   i won  t give anything away  but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than    of the hollywood crap  especially children  s films  out there .  br    br   cheers .  br    br   p . s . there is a  real   original king of masks who can  could do   masks at once . the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to  masks at a time  then they would cut and change to  new masks  .
