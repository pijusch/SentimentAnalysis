of course i would have to give this film   out of   as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of once upon a crime . rodolfo sonego wrote screenplays for over   years living in italy . he was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing . so rodolfo sonego did . if you check out his biography  you can see the number of movies that have been made in italy . alberto sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories . my uncle visited australia and my town  in     to check out locations for  a girl in australia  and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war . you can see his humor in all his movies . i found a copy of this movie on dvd recently . great
