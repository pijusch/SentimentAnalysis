after seeing several movies of villaronga  i had a pretty clear opinion about him   he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters  forgetting about a rhythm of the movie . that is why  though having good critics  his movies never caught the broad audience attention . in aro he follows the same line  but really improved on the rhythm  especially in the end of the movie . frankly speaking  i slept through the first part  cause though the first part gives necessary information  it is really slow . nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villaronga .  br    br   recommended .
