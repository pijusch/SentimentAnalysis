 . . . and i do mean it . if not literally  after all  i have not seen every movie ever created    at least  obviously  among the ones  the many i know .  br    br    .     the rule of thumb with imdb is this sometimes movies rated very highly  for example  the piece of kannes  kompetition  krowned  korean  kraap called  oldboy   can be truly bad . but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under  . this movie  very much worth watching  is . a disgrace .  br    br   true  i give it a   in protest . the movie is not perfect . its true rating should be an  or a  . it has some acting flaws  belafonte especially   the script wanders around  sometimes . however  what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times  the czech jan kadar  directing two of the greatest actors of all time  the beloved  larger  than  life zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an acting  poetic  moral tour de force . a pair made in heaven  it  s true that this movie  little flaws apart  does not pander to the average audiences  but those interested in watching an excellent  while  again  not beyond criticism  movie of the incomparable director who gave us  the shop on the main street   the best movie ever about holocaust  should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that  american beauty  is better than  the angel levine  .  br    br   it isn  t .
