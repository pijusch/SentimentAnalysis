i thought this was an awesome movie . the theme song is sweet    anyway  the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning  when everything should have been normal . it was very weird and unrealistic . the big cable company is mainly what i  m talking about . apart from that  the movie was very creative . i think that all the acting was well done  the actors acted out their characters  personalities perfectly . everything fit together well . it really is a shame that their isn  t a soundtrack . that would have been great  because this is a canadian film  and because it is one of my favorites  i give this movie a   out of
