warning  mild spoilers ahead    br    br    yes  i realize it  s tough to spoil an historical documentary  but i do reveal some of the backstory and methods .   br    br   this is an exceptional documentary not just because of the remarkable footage  but also due to the story behind it . because the naudets did not set out to tell the story of      but rather that of a rookie firefighter  the men  s emotions and the viewer  s connection with them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective .  br    br   in a filmmaking sense        is textbook . if the events were an actual script  they would be superb  as the characters are established  then thrown a curve to which they must react . this is all the more amazing considering the pain and emotion of the raw footage that the directors had to wade through to piece this story together .  br    br   the first portion of the film provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station specifically  how a rookie assimilates himself into a crew of veterans . that part alone is quite good  and had the documentary been allowed to run its intended course  it probably would have been solid . the brothers appear to realistically portray the process of becoming a nyc firefighter .  br    br   then of course  all hell breaks loose . the chaos following the wtc attacks is vividly seen  as various characters that we have gotten to know are thrust into terrifying situations . seeing not only the attacks  but also the first  hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion .  br    br   the aftermath  in which firefighters are discovered to be lost and found  is human drama at its peak . life and death hang in the balance . unlike many movies  the viewer not only doesn  t know who will live and die  but genuinely cares about them .  br    br   the only negative thing i have to say about this is that the robert deniro  whom i like  blurbs were uninformative  unnecessary  and didn  t advance the story at all . they were probably added just to attract more television viewers .  br    br   bottom line the best documentary i  ve ever seen . nonpareil portrayals of raw human emotion and drama .  .  out of   .
