though structured totally different from the book by tim krabb who wrote the original  the vanishing   spoorloos  it does have the same overall feel  except for that koolhoven  s style is less business  like and more lyric . the beginning is great  the middle is fine  but the sting is in the end . a surprise emotional ending . as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film  but it is done all very beautifully . never explicit  but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour . it is a shame american films can  t be as open an honoust as this one . where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject   de grot  stays always within the boundaries of good taste .  de grot  tells an amazing story stretched over more than   years . when you  ll leave the cinema you  ll be moved . what can we ask more of a film  anyway  this film even gives more . . . .
