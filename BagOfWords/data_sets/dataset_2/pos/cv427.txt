it  s been a while since i  ve watched this movie  and the series  but now i  m refreshing my memory  this was a very funny movie based on the classic series  johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together . bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee . when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm  bo and luke sneak around hogg  s local construction site and find samples of coal . they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna strip  mine hazzard county  unless the dukes can stop him  with the help of their beautiful cousin  daisy . my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn  t right for the part of boss hogg  and sheriff rosco p . coltrane was way too serious . other than that  i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard
