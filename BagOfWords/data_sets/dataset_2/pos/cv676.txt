i saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary . what i love most about it is that it is understated and low  key  but deeply heartfelt . henry thomas   he played the child in e . t .  performance is masterfully inarticulate  he is supposed to be a man of few words  . david straithern is a wonderful crazy villain . and miraculously  given that we  re talking about a hollywood product here  a baby serves as a main character  but one who doesn  t act or have lines  but rather just is   is luminous at that  . interesting to note that thomas  mysterious relationship w . e . t . was the core of that film while his bond w . the baby serves as the core of  a good baby .   br    br   then there is the music   ah  what music   gillian welch  s tunes are wonderful  the entire score is gorgeous hill country music .  br    br   this film is wonderfully atmospheric . i recommend it highly .
