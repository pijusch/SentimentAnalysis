the critics didn  t like this film . it bombed in the states and as a result received only a limited showing in britain . which was a great shame  because it represents british rather than american humour and should have been shown in britain first .  br    br   nicole kidman looks stunning and is a totally convincing russian . ben chaplin is the dustin hoffman character from  the graduate   and  birthday girl  has at least  scenes which remind the viewer of that     s classic  despite being a totally different story   .  br    br   sure it changes tack a number of times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure  but it  s memorable  moving and a weclome breath of fresh air compared to the average mega  budget blockbuster .  br    br   see it with an open mind
