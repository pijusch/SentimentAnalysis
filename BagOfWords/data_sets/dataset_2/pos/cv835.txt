this was the most visually stunning  moving  amazing and incredible story i  ve ever experienced . quite frankly  even those adjectives just cannot describe it . i can  t just choose one scene that stood out for me . i suppose if i had to list a few it would be the reactions of the fireman to the crashing sound of jumping victims the reaction of people trapped in the elevator  who were unaware of what was going on  as they finally emerge to the horrific scene the shock and disbelief of the onlookers and finally the silence .  br    br   on that day  and even now  i am reminded of star wars       . obi  wan says  i felt a great disturbance in the force  as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced .  it is amazing how it is so accurate in its description . there was truly a disturbance in the force .  br    br   this documentary vividly reveals this disturbance . the feelings are so incredibly visual . the anger  the frustration  the shock  the fear  the exhaustion  and the realization of its very magnitude . it  s all there . not a thing is missed .  br    br   this is a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the emmy . not just because it documents     but because it is simply everything it should be .  br    br   if you plan to watch  be sure to grab a box of tissues . you  ll need them . i know that i did .
