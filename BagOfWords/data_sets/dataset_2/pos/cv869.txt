i enjoyed this movie . haven  t seen andy griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly . i  ve associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he  s versatile .  br    br   i wasn  t troubled that dotty  s  anxiety disorder  may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook . there are zillions of whatever  phobias and neuroses  and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms . she is clearly a sensitive with extra  sensory powers as was understood by the local indians but not by any anglos . it is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric .  br    br   although this is taken to be a light  family movie   it is actually more sophisticated than it seems . also  hiram  s twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle . it  s fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance .
