i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his  her reluctant guardian . i  ve seen enough of them  baby boom  kolya  about a boy  mostly martha  and to some extent  whale rider  to expect to be bored by the formula . what held my attention in the king of masks was the grimness of the setting small  town china in the      s . extreme poverty was the norm  and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market . when wang discovers his purchased grandson  whom he  s nicknamed  doggie   is a granddaughter  he initially casts her out  even though she  s showed great promise as street  performing heir . even after he reluctantly takes her back  he  s not too upset when she  s kidnapped . the film is gritty then  showing the lengths to which a young  street  smart girl had to go to survive in that society .  br    br   the two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context . in a western society  one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success . wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status  though  that i did  too . while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern  suburban child  it  s completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage . and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her  her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sense .  br    br   the peek at small  town life in a foreign country  the naturalness of the two lead actors  the surprising plot twists  and of course  the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film .
