this film is definitely an odd love story . though this film may not be much to shout about  nicole kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten  though ben chaplin does do quite a good job of hertfordshire life with shots of st albans  hemel hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area . what starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular british tv series  heartbeat  soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flick . nothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus ends  up as fairly decent weekend entertainment . a good one to watch  and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character .
