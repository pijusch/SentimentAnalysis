michael stearns plays mike  a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality . he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that  s when he loses it . he believes that when women actually have sex that  s when they lose any sense of  innocence  and  or  beauty  . so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance  ultimately shooting the men dead with a high  powered rifle with a scope .  br    br   the seeming primary reason for this movie  s existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again . the  story  comes off as more of an afterthought . this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we  re treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity  the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes  and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation . of course  seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism .  for one thing  mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger .  this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack .  br    br   those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another . it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain how to react . it unfolds at a very slow pace  but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist . it  s a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen .  br    br
