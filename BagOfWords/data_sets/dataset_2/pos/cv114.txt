i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it  but have seen it  or more times a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical  comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence . kay kyser  s mysteries would be a good example .  br    br   having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show  as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action  doing a fine job of support . hugh o  brien plays the face  buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus  abbott and costello replacing the leads . don  t know if that was true .  br    br   all in all  a pleasant movie  but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history . wish that it was released  as i haven  t seen or heard of it now in two decades . hope it is not lost
