i was so impressed with doug mcgrath  s film version of the jane austen novel  emma   and i loved the music score by rachel portman so much  that when i went to the video store one day and discovered the two had re  united for  nicholas nickleby  i immediately rented it without any other consideration .  br    br   i have read the book  and for those overly  critical fans of this jane austen adaptation  i don  t know what else mcgrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of miss austen  s work  especially given the limitations of a two hour movie  which some have complained about being too long   . and as far as gwen paltrow  s accent is concerned  i must confess i wasn  t too familiar with her when i saw this at the theater initially  and i was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an english actress   br    br   i am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery . that is one of the things i enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the english countryside . the film  s beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success . if your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker  then perhaps you should rent something like  death wish iii    br    br   the english country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast  and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings . mcgrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story .  br    br   this refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex  violence or even a villainous antagonist . the story is often amusing  endearing  and at times  quite touching .  br    br   i have seen many competent jane austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite .
