lars von triers europa is an extremely good film . how  s that  von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story  at least he did have with europa . to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen . even with all the tricks  in my opinion  this film is the most complete  real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top    list . i also think it is perhaps the scariest  the most gothic and complete film around . all right there are other good ones too  but this one is my favorite . the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever .
