hurrah  a space film that doesn  t take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp . the film starts slowly  the usual mix of idiots and high  fliers mixed together into a dodgy soup . but when the going gets tough  the tough get themselves sorted out and it  s not an un  believable change in the characters as you can believe that there  s some responsibility in their young minds .  br    br   the only flaw in the film is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as the  i  m right and you  re all wrong  instructor . i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a  vote .
