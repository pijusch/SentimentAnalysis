a delightful gentle comedic gem  until the last five minutes  which degenerate into run of the mill british tv farce . the last five minutes cost it  points in my rating . despite this major plot and style flaw  it  s worth watching for the character acting and the unique cornwall setting . many fine little bits to savor  like the tense eternity we all go through waiting for the bank approval after the clerk has swiped the credit card . . . made more piquant when we  re not  quite  sure the card is not maxed .
