i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm  happy feeling . i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time  i thoroughly enjoyed this film . the acting was superb  although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance . bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films . timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance . and billy connolly  as always  totally gorgeous . it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned . such a refreshing experience to see a well  written  superbly acted and good  looking movie .
