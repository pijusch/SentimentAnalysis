to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue  the budget  the this and the that . . . . who wants to hear it  if you missed the point of this beyond  beautiful movie  that  s your loss . the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think . i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life  and this one stands in its own entity  in my book . it was not supposed to be a documentary  or a completely factual account of what happened that night . it is the most amazing love story ever attempted . i know that it is the cynical    s and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy  but come on . someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money  how lame is that  it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet  and is the top grossing film in the planet . i will gladly side with the majority this time around . okay  cynics  time to crawl back under your rock  i am done .
