i found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while i tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why . one of the problems is the cultural  language one . here we have a chinese  taiwanese  japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading english subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties . another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences . nevertheless  it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad miiki film and this certainly is not that . plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence  a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect . all in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one .
