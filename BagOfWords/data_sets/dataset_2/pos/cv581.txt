emma is a true romance . if you love the soppy stuff  charged with wit and folly  you will love this movie  its true to the novel  which is very important  with a few twists added for pleasure . gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades . she shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to .  br    br   jeremy northam  as the hero . how shocked are you  i never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck  what the right role can do for you  he looks so good as the sensible  regal mr . k  that i am literally looking at him in a new light . he makes and excellent romantic lead . the charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful   br    br   ewan mcgregor  greta sacchi brings in the rest . a good cast . a good movie . if you are a fan of jane austen  see this movie  along with pride and prejudice  and most importantly  buy the books . it enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary
