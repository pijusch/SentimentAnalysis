what can i say that hasn  t been said about  the haunting   it has everything that would make a great picture . wonderful sets  moody music  and sound design to die for were all in place . the screenplay  though  sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird  surrealistic way . the entire team must have forgotten to read it through  maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was . each member of the cast gives a worthy performance  although with little conviction to the material at hand . lili taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her . but that  s about it . all i can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours  but you will definitely want more . a lot more .
