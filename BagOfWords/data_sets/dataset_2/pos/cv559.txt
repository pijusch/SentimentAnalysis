when i first got my n   when i was five or six  i fell in love with it  and my first game was super mario   . and i loved it  the graphics were great for it  s time  a good plot  great courses and above all  the best music i heard in a nintendo game .  br    br   i don  t remember the plot completely  but i think princess peach was kidnapped by bowser  and mario has to rescue her . the object of the game is to get    stars from the curses in the castle . each had about five or six challnges to get the stars . there are secert parts of the castle  where you can get more stars . but of course  you have beat bowser . i think there are three levels to beat bowser on lets start with the characters . mario is the main character  and gets helpful advice from toad  so he is basically one of your only alliances . i heard that luigi and yoshi are in the game towards the end . the main villain is bowser  and there are a bunch of other characters like boo and goomba . the characters are really great .  br    br   next  how about the graphics  people say gameplay is more important then the graphics  and i agree completely . but with he great plot  there are great graphics . especially for it  s time . i have a whole bunch of other nintendo games like    and their graphics don  t compare to super mario . bright colors  great effects and awesome sound effects . i found the graphics in the water courses very very good . next to the bowser world ones  it has the best graphics in the game .  br    br   now  the music . this is my favorite part of the game . growing up  when i played this at a young age  i  d gladly leave the game on all night so the music would put me to sleep . especially the music from jolly roger bay  which was peaceful and wonderful . there are others that are great too  especially in  once again  the worlds with bowser  are the ones that stick with me the most and are my favorites .  br    br   this game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer  and i love it . this game gets      or          go play the game
