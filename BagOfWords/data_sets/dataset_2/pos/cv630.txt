i loved this film  seen this evening on a movie theatre big screen  the audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things  and the fast pace was most enjoyable .  br    br   i do  as a singer and musical director  question one section of roby keeler  s vocal in  by a waterfall .  the key modulated  and she was suddenly singing much lower  in a very mellow voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tin  like higher twitter voice she used in all her other vocals .  br    br   does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer  it sounds it to me . i would love to know .  br    br   thanks so much .
