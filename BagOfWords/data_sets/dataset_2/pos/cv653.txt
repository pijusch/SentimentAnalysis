i enjoyed longstreet  which followed in the steps of raymond burr  s successful ironside tv series and was intended to give it competition . but this show was canceled after one season because it was decided   i believe wrongly   that longstreet was not able to compete with mr . burr  s ironside .  br    br   i may add that the pilot for this show was especially well done and very memorable . i hope that a box set of longstreet will appear .  br    br   writers should note that this story idea was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the play and interplay of disabilities on tv .
