i don  t understand . not being a critic  i am not evaluating the quality of the acting  which i find believable  a good thing . my confusion lies with the content . is no one else sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women were justifying their infidelity to men who were fighting and bleeding to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country . should there not have been a prologue informing us if the men made it home and if so  what effect their cheating  wives   infidelity had on them  while these women were bedding their paramours out of a sense loneliness  did they think that their husbands were enjoying being shot at while facing death or dismemberment daily  they didn  t think of their husbands at all  only of themselves . pardon me  except when they wished their husbands dead .
