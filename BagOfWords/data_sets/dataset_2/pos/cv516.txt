even this early in his career  capra was quite accomplished with his camera  work and his timing . this is a thin story   and quite predictable at times   but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately . the first part looks like a cinderella story  though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that   the rich  prince  will lose his fortune .  br    br   nonetheless  because of his good cast and fast pace  it  s easy to get caught up in the clichs . then the movie does become more original  as the married couple have to find a way to make a living . the ending is very predictable but satisfying . i also want to compliment the title  writing very witty and fun .
