titanic is a classic . i was really surprised that this movie didn  t have a solid ten  overall in the imdb user rankings . maybe  it  s just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays  but when it was first made it was really something . when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters . when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month . it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason . some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot  like the frozen baby  or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd . many people died on that ship  and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to . and let  s not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose . whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone  s imagination it was lovely . they barely knew each other  but they would die for each other . they trusted each other . they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money .  i  ll never let go  jack .  titanic is a great film down to it  s very core . it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting  excellent cinematography  beautiful music  and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers . it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie .
