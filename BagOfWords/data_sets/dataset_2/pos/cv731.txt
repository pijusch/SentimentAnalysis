  i like cheap perfume better it doesn  t last as long . . .   ralph meeker  s convict character  lawson  tells this to barbara stanwyck  s helen character  after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out w  her husband in tijuana . . .  this line cracked me up  and also seemed like a metaphor for this film  that cheap is better than expensive  because a cheap perfume  loving man who has a way with a  x  is a better man to have around in the long run  i agree with some of the other comments posted about helen  s attraction to lawson . even though her narration states that she wants lawson to be put away  she did seem attracted to his fiery nature  and that passion he stirred up in her wouldn  t likely wash away with the tide
