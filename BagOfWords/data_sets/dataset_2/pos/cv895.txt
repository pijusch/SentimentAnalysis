i felt this film  throughout . i waas impressed with russell crowe  s talent in developing his relationship with lillie  such a typical aussie blend of softly softly approach  a bit self depreciating and very persistent . really loved the cinematography and direction . pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive .  br    br   gosh  didn  t russell  s talent even in     shine  . . and i have yet to see gladiator .
