now this show looks like most of the other shows of it  s type from the mid     s  but the only thing is about this one is that it  s different  they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too . i personally thought it was a good show  i can  t understand why would they cancel it . the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since     up to date .  br    br   my hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie  which i know is gonna be impossible to do  but hey it doesn  t hurt to dream  doesn  t it   br    br   anyway  i would recommend if you hadn  t seen it to find the dvd of all   episodes  because the characters are great  the story lines are good  the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great .
