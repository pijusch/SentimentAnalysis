i have a feeling that the warners bros depression  era musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years . yes  we are in the economic doldrums  or have you been living under a rock  and times look bleak . but we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles . in the    s  film  going was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom .  footlight parade        was one such film that audiences flocked to . while this lloyd bacon  directed musical doesn  t quite capture the social issues of the time as  gold diggers of            does  it  s still a wonderful showcase of talent . we have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece busby berkely extravaganza numbers  but boy  are they worth waiting for me . yes  little ruby keeler is a terrible singer and actress  and her tapping is so  so  but busby  s magical  by a waterfall  whisks her  and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls  into a dizzying water wonderland . of course busby  s numbers could never really be performed on a stage  they defy limits of gravity  for one thing   and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough  wisecracking non  musical scenes . and  footlight  also has james cagney in at the one of his all  too  few musicals  really  what couldn  t this man do   . he even gets to take over from the leading man  don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot shanghai lil  who is really little ruby in china  girl wig   . he co  stars with joan blondell  his adorable  adoring secretary who cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women  until the final reel  that is  . apparently blondell was the only other woman who cagney loved apart from his wife . and you can see the mutual adoration in every scene .
