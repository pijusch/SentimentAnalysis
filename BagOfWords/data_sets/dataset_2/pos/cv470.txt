yes  be my love was mario lanza  s skyrocket to fame and still is popular today . his voice was strong and steady  so powerful in fact that mgm decided to use him in the great caruso . lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of caruso . having read the book by kostelanitz who wrote a biography of lanza  he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary caruso to lanza . there is no doubt that lanza did a superb job in the story  but the story is not entirely true blame it on hollywood  i used to practise singing his songs years ago  and became pretty good myself until i lost my voice because of emphysema  asthma ten years ago . reaching the high note of be my love is not easy but beautiful
