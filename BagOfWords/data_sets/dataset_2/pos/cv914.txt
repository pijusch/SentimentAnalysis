i  ve always liked johnny concho and i wish this film were out on vhs and dvd . frank sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this one .  br    br   when we first meet frank in the film  s title role  he  s the brother of a notorious gunfighter who  s out of town at the moment . the brother strikes terror in the heart  s of the town and frank takes full advantage of that to bully the townspeople safe and secure in his shadow . only phyllis kirk has any feeling for him . she  s the daughter of storekeeper wallace ford and dorothy adams .  br    br   two other gunmen arrive william conrad and christopher dark and it turns out conrad has killed sinatra  s brother and he  s coming to his town to take over . they humiliate sinatra and run him out of town . kirk follows him .  br    br   overnight sinatra turns from punk into coward and becomes a man searching for some kind of backbone . it  s a well acted performance  almost as good as his oscar nominated role in the man with a golden arm . pity for some reason this has not been seen for years .  br    br   two other performances of note are keenan wynn as former gunfighter turned preacher who helps sinatra find what he needs to stand up to conrad and dark . and then there is conrad in what i believe was his career role on screen . he  s a villain of incredible malevolence  pure evil incarnate walking and talking on the silver screen .  br    br   however what i like about johnny concho is the climax an unforgettable one where conrad and dark are dealt with . let  s just say i believe johnny concho was mgm  s answer to high noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a break down in all law and order .
