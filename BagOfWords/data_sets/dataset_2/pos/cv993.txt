surviving christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released . ben affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for christmas . he then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for christmas cheer . i have not been a ben affleck fan in the past  though i did like daredevil and paycheck  but here he is well cast in this role . i also like christina applegate as the daughter in the family who can  t stand affleck  s character at first . sure you can see where this movie is going but you don  t care . ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of christmas movies .
