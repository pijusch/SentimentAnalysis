  contrary to most reviews i  ve read  i didn  t feel this followed any of the other rock movies   spinal tap   etc .  the story was more unique  although i feel most people wanted to see the  sex  drugs  rock and roll  vices that the band kept alluding to .  br    br    as an american  i knew a few of the actors  spall  connelly  rea . surprised to find out  brian   bruce robinson was in zifferedi  s   sp   classic  romeo  juliet  . guess i  ll have to rent that next .  br    br     the flame still burns   my wife  who hails from mexico  didn  t follow the english  british language too well  missed some of the jokes  which i dutifully explained  but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene . she loves the song so much now .  br    br    funny that amazon . com has the soundtrack for    usd when i bought the dvd in the bargain bin at wal  mart for   .   usd . price non  withstanding  i first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since .
