when i first saw  a cry in the dark   i had no idea what the plot was . but when i saw it  i was shocked at what it portrayed . when i saw it a second time in an australian cinema class  i realized a second point communication issues . you see  when a dingo snatched lindy chamberlain  s  meryl streep  baby  she and her husband michael  sam neill  were grief  stricken but didn  t show it . as seventh day adventists  they believed that god willed this to happen  and so they couldn  t mourn it . but when people all over australia saw their lack of sadness  everyone started believing that lindy did it herself .  br    br   the point is  the wrong message got communicated to the public  and it turned people against lindy . even though this was a pure accident  it still happened . it may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media  regardless of any media outlet  s political views .  br    br   as for the performances  streep does a very good job with an australian accent  no surprise there   and sam neill is equally great . you will probably get blown away just by what you see here . definitely one of fred schepisi  s best movies ever .
