  still crazy  is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all  time . it has been erroneously compared to  this is spinal tap   which it has no relation to .  spinal tap  is a satire  and  quite frankly  not a very good one  in spite of it  s  outing  of many rock clichs  . unlike  tap    still crazy  is populated by great actors  great songs and great human situations . you care about the people in  still crazy  . that  s all that matters . oh  yeah  the music  s pretty damn good  too  written by mick jones of foreigner and chris difford of squeeze . american audiences were already familiar with stephen rea  the crying game   but would only later become familiar with bill nighy  underworld  love actually  pirates of the caribbean ii  and timothy spall  the harry potter movies  .
