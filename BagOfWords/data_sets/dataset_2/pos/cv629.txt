a wonder . one of the best musicals ever . the three busby berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular  but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible non  stop patter and the natural acting of cagney and blondell .  keeler is also lovely  even though she may not have been a great actress  . there  s a freshness in the movie that you don  t see in flicks today  much less in the usually stilted   s films  even though the plot  involving the setting up of movies prologues  is quite dated .
