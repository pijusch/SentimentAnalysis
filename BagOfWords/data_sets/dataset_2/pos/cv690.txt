simply put  this is the best movie to come out of michigan since . . . well  ever  evil dead eat your heart out  hatred of a minute was some of the oddest  and best cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time . i recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip  or a good case of the willies
