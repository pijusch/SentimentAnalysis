dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt  one of the most amazing shows ever produced  but not just in the field of animation . while the first part  acts  and   mostly consists of action and fun  the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part . the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant . you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part  acts   and   . i do have some complaints though . in the first part  the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all . one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool . buaku rules .
