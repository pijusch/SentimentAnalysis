if i didn  t know any better  it almost seems like it was staged  but it wasn  t . it was set up perfectly  and how they got all of that footage is amazing  the unfortunate events of september        are put together well in this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this an unfortunate classic . just the history in the footage alone should make it a must see for any american or person touched by the tragedy of september   .
