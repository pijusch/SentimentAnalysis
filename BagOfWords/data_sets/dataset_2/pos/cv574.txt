lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of jane austen  s satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial   th century england . northam and paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other . good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material  which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism  . i liked the look of the film and how shots were set up  and i thought it didn  t rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the   s and   s do . very good results .
