get ready for it this is one of my favourite films of all time . i am relatively unaware of david mamet  s  writer and director  other works but after having watched this film half a dozen times  it  s always a joy to watch   i can say without hesitation that he is a genius . this film is extremely well written  and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit  con  artistry and back room hustles . the feel of the film is very similar to the sting       and it also pays homage to film noir .  br    br   it  s quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters . it is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch .  br    br   generally  the acting is superb  especially joe mantegna  but someone who i watched the film with remarked to me that it  s not a good idea to have a heroine  lindsay crouse  who is not only a gambler  a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad    s hairdo . i agree  but i think she is nevertheless outstanding in the role .  br    br   the less you know about the plot of this film  the better  just like mamet  s most recent film  the spanish prisoner  because the ending will be even more impressive . just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance .
