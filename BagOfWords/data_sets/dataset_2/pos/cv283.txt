this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best . at the same time  it looks realistic and unrealistic  just knowing that the movie is fake . the story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways . a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address  and it includes a manga video  showing the torture . the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die . some scenes are shocking  such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched    times  because you see punches in nearly every movie . this movie has a lot of gore so i would recommend this to people   or older .  br    br
