i have to say that the events of     didn  t hit me until i saw this documentary . it took me a year to come to grips with the devastation . i was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers . i was sick of hearing about it . when this was aired on tv a year and a day later  i was bawling my eyes out . it was the first time i had cried since the attack . i highly recommend this documentary . i am watching it now on tv   years later  and i am still crying over the tragedies . the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing . it was an accident  and look where it got them . these two brothers make me want to have been there to help .
