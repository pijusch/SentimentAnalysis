i notice the dvd version seems to have missing scenes or lines between the posting of the frf and the launch .  br    br   they are to prove they can win the right to sit in the frf other than the green team .  br    br   another scene is like during their failure at the simulation  kevin gets joaquin to clam down .  br    br   i think the vhs edition other than the abc one might have all the missing stuff .  br    br   otherwise i like to know which dvd release has the missing stuff .  br    br   the dvd i have watched feels edited for television .
