the previous reviewer has said it exactly . i saw it once  was enchanted  saw it a second time when it was re  broadcast within a week or two of the first airing . i still remember some of the scenes . the setting is the opening of the   th century  the war referred to in the title is world war i . one of the scenes was set in a women  only section of a public place  which was an interesting historical note . the moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my all  time great movie moments . i don  t think of this as a  gay movie   it  s an interesting and tender period love story  where the two principals happen to be women . i would love to see this movie again i would buy this one if it ever came out on dvd .
