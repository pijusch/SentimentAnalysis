what a good movie  at last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock illusions of fame . well  known rockers are getting old and forgotten  not the music . and with a good sense of humour . have you ever danced on bill haley  s rock around the clock   br    br   anyway  still crazy is probably the best movie about rock n  roll i have ever seen . far much better than spinal tap for instance . why  because in still crazy  people are mature . they have a different point of view about rock  about love and about life . they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much . beyond the story itself  we see characters with their own personality  weaknesses and dreams . like anyone of us .  br    br   spend a good time watching this  listen to the awesome soundtrack   and finally thinking of your own future .  br    br   bye
