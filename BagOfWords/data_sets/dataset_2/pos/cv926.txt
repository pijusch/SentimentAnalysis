i didn  t approach  still crazy  with any real anticipation . just another rock  n  roll picture  i figured . . . good nostalgia for the baby boomers . this film is partially that  but so much more . brian gibson  the director  previously helmed a biography of tina turner  and is quite successful in his style . i suppose it is fitting that this was his last film .  br    br   the cast is well  chosen . bill nighy is perfect in his role as the band  s frontman . actor  turned  director bruce robinson appears as the band  s washed  up guitarist . he does a superb job  even though he hasn  t appeared on film since the late    s . if you  re looking for an touching and funny film  with some great songs   you  ve found it .  br    br    .  out of
