when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves . that being said  we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood . . .  br    br   writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded   br    br   with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life  jess  and the world around him  donna  .  br    br   as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably . the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward .  br    br   it  s to bad that most people will avoid this film . i only say that because the average american will probably think  robin williams in a serious role  that didn  t work before   please give this movie a chance  robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people . like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art .  br    br   oh and before i forget  i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in . he has the      s leading man looks and screen presence . it  s this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now    br    br   s
