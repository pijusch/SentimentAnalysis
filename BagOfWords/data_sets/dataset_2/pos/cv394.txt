fascinating movie  based on a true story  about an australian woman  lindy chamberlain  meryl streep  accused of killing her baby daughter . she insists that a dingo took her baby  but the story is highly suspicious . the film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case  the way australians interpreted what was presented in the media  and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman  s conviction  based on barely any hard evidence . i love films that question the media  and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system . i  ve always thought that juries ought to be showed   angry men before they go through with their duties . it  s not  as has often been said  a liberal movie  but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge . a cry in the dark is likewise clinical . schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic . some may find the film boring or dry  but i found it engaging .
