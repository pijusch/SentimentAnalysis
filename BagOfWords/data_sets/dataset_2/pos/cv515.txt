for all of you that don  t speak swedish the swedish original title of this film  rnarna  translates into something in the line of  the robbers  . this fact is the main problem i have with the film  cause it  s not really about the robbers at all . it  s about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies . a regular desk job one would think  but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands  as the story goes  even shooting one of the robbers . . . exactly we  ve seen this before . the fact that there  s a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesn  t really help as the ending is just as clich as the first two thirds of the film .  br    br   what saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that it  s masterfully executed in all ways  that the actors are as great as they are and don  t overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the story .  br    br   one thing that i really loved about this film is the fact that it  s music sets the right mood when it  s needed  but is absent for the rest of the time  which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and car  chases spread throughout the film . a nice touch  the fact that michael persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that he  s not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background  but that  s something you have to neglect .  br    br   all in all it  s an entertaining film that steals more money in it  s plot than time from you .
