an angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather . together they find common ground in the gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders . although tragic episodes  such as the highland clearances  feature in the stories  there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them . it  s all filmed in skye  so there is a double dose of beauty . the mountain scenery is breathtaking  and it  s a rare chance to hear scottish gaelic spoken . i  m english  so i had to read the subtitles  but the sound of spoken gaelic is nonetheless wonderful . the performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non  actors  in other words  you are watching the real thing  people who care deeply about gaelic folklore and history . the gaelic community  especially on skye  worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film . anyone who has the slightest interest in gaelic  folk history  folk music  oral culture  scotland  british history  multi  culturalism or social justice should go and see this film .
