my cable tv has what  s called the arts channel  which is a  catch  as  catch  can  situation sometimes  sometimes films  sometimes short clips of films or ballets  and i came into this just as the bar scene came on  where they tear up their coupons . excellent  exquisite  ealing wins again  my wartime  glasgow  raised mother would love this  should i ever find a copy of it . some of britain  s best artists  from mr holloway to wayne and radford and the delicious miss rutherford  having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the home office . loved the last scene  where as soon as they are  back in england   the temperature plummets and it rains . . .
