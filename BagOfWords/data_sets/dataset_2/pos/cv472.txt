the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in     and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most  movergoers  were stay  at  homes watching their new   motorola televisions . almost all recent box office figures are false    because they fail to adjust inflation . obviously today  s    movies will dominate . in     it cost   c to   .   at radio city   c to   c first run at loew  s palace in washington dc  or   c to   c in neighborhood runs . what counts is the number of people responding to the picture  not unadjusted box office  media spin .  the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso  really not a great story anyway  and threw it in the trash . instead     of the movie  s focus was on the music . thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best  ever historic opera singer enrico caruso . the result was a wonderful movie . too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating . too fat to play the student prince  edmund purdom took his place    with lanza  s voice dubbed in  and with the formerly handsome and not  fat lanza pictured in the advertising . if you want to see the great caruso  it  s almost always on ebay for   .   or less . don  t be put off by the low price  as it reflects only the easy availability of copies  not the quality of the movie .
