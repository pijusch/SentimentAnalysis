i remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the lifetime tv network and thought it was an interesting story . several years later i see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie . the story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself . the cast just makes it that much more appealing . meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture . she nails mrs . chamberlain  s mannerisms  the accent  and even look . she shows the pain  hurt  surprise  and anger that lindy had to endure  and in the process it  s hard to remember that it isn  t lindy . in my opinion  this performance of meryl  s was better than her oscar  winning turn in  sophie  s choice   and should have garnered her her third oscar . sam neill is perfect as michael chamberlain  and for some surprising reason  wasn  t recognized by the academy with at least a nomination . in all  this movie only receive one oscar nod  streep  s for best actress .  however  it did receive several australian oscars and nominations .  br    br   definitely a top  rate movie it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast .
