an excellent cast makes this movie work all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and it  s clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie .  br    br   it  s not quite the comedy i expected  much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor . for music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funny .  br    br   i hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies  but so much of this movie reminded me of alan parker films i can  t help it imagine if the commitments actually did make it big   and then tried to recapture said glory   years later .
