imdb lists this as     for some reason  but the other sources i  ve seen including the excellent program notes mark it as    . doesn  t really matter  except that it  s quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video  one of the first art works to merge the two apparently  in the context of the star gate sequence in      released the same year . pure abstraction isn  t really my thing  but i can take it in small doses and the super  saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers  rohrschach blots  birds  etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful . certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the   s  and deserves to be better known .
