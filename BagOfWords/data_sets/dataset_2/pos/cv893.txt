stuck in a hotel in kuwait  i happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning . first pachelbel  s canon brought a lump to my throat  then the sight of a tiger moth  which my grandfather  my father and i have all flown  produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then crowe  s name hooked me completely . i was entranced by this film  crowe  s performance  again   the subject matter  and yes  what a debt we owe   how various matters were addressed and dealt with  the flying sequences  my father flew avro ansons  too   the story  and  as another contributor pointed out  crowe  s recitation of high flight . i won  t spoil the film for anyone  but  separated from my wife by       odd miles  as an ex  army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot  i admit to crying heartily a couple of times . buy it  rent it  download it  beg  borrow or steal it  but watch it .  br    br   ps did i spy a bristol blenheim  in yellow training colours  on the ground  looked like a twin  engine aircraft with a twin  .    brownings in a dorsal turret .
