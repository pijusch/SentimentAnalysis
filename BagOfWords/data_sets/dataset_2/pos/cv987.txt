cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams . it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations  both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget .  br    br   there are many great laughs  even if the story is somewhat thin  sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late     s hollywood comedy style . a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses  which must have sounded quite excessive to a     audience . as he makes his exit  he assures the client  grant  that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of     .   from the total . . . or at least    .   . . . but certainly    .   . hilarious
