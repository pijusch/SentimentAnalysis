i have to agree with mr . caruso jr lanza  s was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the american caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be so be it . see the film you  ll see why mr lanza still come up in discussion even in my house . someone says pavarotti i say mario lanza . as for the film itself when will it be on dvd they must have it restored and vhs isn  t good enough but this should also be the only lanza film put on dvd the others are down right bad and boring .
