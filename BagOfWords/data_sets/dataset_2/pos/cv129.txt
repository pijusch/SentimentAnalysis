an excellent and accurate film . . . mcgovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off . he is not afraid to tell the truth  even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy .  br    br   once again  mcgovern brings in christopher eccleston  though not in as high a profile a role as he played in hillsborough . i found this movie as accurate  well acted and well presented as hillsborough and i applaud mcgovern for his poignant unapologetic writing . well done and my hat is off to the writer  the actors  the production crew . a great film
