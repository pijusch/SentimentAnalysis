i was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in england . i  ve seen hundreds of films since  but i  ve never forgotten this one . although sinatra was playing a not very endearing character  he was excellent in the role . a lot of people seem to think that he did  nt really come into his own until his role in  from here to eternity  but in my opinion he was magnificent in concho . the other role that sticks in my mind is that of william conrad . i  d never see or heard of him before this film . conrad plays a terrific part in this film . i remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his character . also i remember the music  that both introduces conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appears . an excellent film and my only disappointment was that i never ever got the chance to see it again . it seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth . i see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when i saw it was indeed in full color  i remember sinatra  s blue shirt .
