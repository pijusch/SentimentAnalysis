i love this movie . my friend marcus and i were browsing the local hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film . we had no idea what it was going to be about  but it turned out spectacular .  thumbs up . i liked how the film was shot  and the actors were very funny . if you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think i highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie . i would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so i won  t . this movie is definitely on my top   list of good movies . do you really think nothing is bouncy
