this is a great film .  br    br   i agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this . i had never heard of it or anyone in it  excpet mike from friends  .  br    br   but it is great  eva  lake and paul give amazing performances . the humour is consistently dry and witty .  br    br   paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends  which works great  . the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic  i mean we are not talking  apocalypse now  here  but the characters are likable  the story is engaging  the soundtrack  production and direction all work well .  br    br   in all a great feel  good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets .  br    br   everyone has their own tastes but i really don  t understand the one star reviews for this .
