enjoyed the movie and efficient confucian crime drama  the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man  no doubt representing modern society . i thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big d was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long . i loved the scene and for once in a chinese movie  the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest . on thing that always amuses me about hk films is that the main influence the british seem to have had is to introduce  yes sir  and  sorry  into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone  they are still there .
