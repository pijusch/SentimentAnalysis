this is a family film  which to some people is an automatic turn off . it seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with failing arms and legs  gratuitous violence and enough expletives to fill the new york phone book . this film is none of those . it is clich  it is formula  but it is also fun . it doesn  t ask you to think  it doesn  t demand that you accept the film as reality . it simply does what a good film ought to do  which is to willingly suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure . the cast is good  while not excellent . as another commenter pointed out the john williams sound score was  as usual  excellent . and the fact that a lot of the film was shot in huntsville at the real space camp made it even more believable .  br    br   it was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some months due to the challenger shuttle disaster  which may have played a large part in it  s original theatrical opening  but the film eventually has helped to focus the dreams of many young people back towards space and the possibilities that lie therein . so sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy .
