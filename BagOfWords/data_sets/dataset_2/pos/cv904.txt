given the opposite circumstance of     where the reality is we do have a black president  this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance . for entertainment value i found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant . i was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time  but also found the music and dancing incredible . also it is quite cool to see sammy davis jr as such a very young child actor . he plays rufus jones  a young boy who is being consoled by his mammy . he is told  why some day you could be president  . this was so ridiculous in     that it was mocked and thought to be endearing  charming and funny . the bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man . they depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist baptist church .  br    br   the fact was when i stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in . it is really well done and very entertaining . i believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us . in fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president  but that it is normal  just makes this movie that much more relevant . it clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness .
