this game is amazing . really  you should get it if you don  t have it . although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out . i believe that this game will always be a classic . it  s just as good a super mario world or so . when i was young  my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did . it  s not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy  but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential . it  s fun entertaining and challenging . everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics   well it did come out in     .  rock on  eva mario luigi and yoshi    nintendo is the best
