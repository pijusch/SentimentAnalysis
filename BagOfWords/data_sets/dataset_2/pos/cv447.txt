i first saw thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the jinn i guess . as any kid would be  i was delighted with the imagination  inventiveness and energy of the film . several years later  i realized how much of the satire and wit of the script i had missed on that first viewing . i have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years . in addition to the script  the production transcends the fantasy genre . this is korda  the storyteller at his very best . when you see thief as a child you know that youve had a great time . when you see thief as an adult you know that youve seen a masterpiece . its as timeless as the story it treats . an amazing work .  br    br   thomas mccarthy
