gotta start with ed furlong on this one . you gotta . god bless this kid .   bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he  s really like in real life . he has a one  liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script . you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn  t even seem like furlong is even acting . maybe that  s why his performance was good . same with madsen . you keep thinking   i bet this guy is really like this in real life .  does madsen even have to act  just natural . vosloo has obviously moved on from the type  casted mummy guy . i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiro  s performance . her reactions are spot  on in this film . i battled if she was hot or not  but realized i would just like to see more of her .  br    br   not a big fan of shoot  em out  hostage type films . but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing . it  s not just your standard robbers take over a bank  they kill hostages  and the good guys win in the end type of film . the twists keep on coming . . . and coming .  br    br   the caf scenes work best with the hand  held cams to show what it  s really like in there . not glossed over a bit . think like bourne ultimatum  lite  style on some scenes in the caf .  br    br   and for those bo bice fanatics out there  actor curtis wayne  who plays karl  will make you do a double take . these guys are twins .  br    br   as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town . made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries  states so they might have these accents . but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of . and some of them are smoking hot . moncia dean  need i say more .
