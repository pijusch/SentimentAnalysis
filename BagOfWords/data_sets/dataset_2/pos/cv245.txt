that hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say .  it  s funny on its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally  too .  only two of the sisters are really bad . boy  are they bad  too  one is given to pinup poses and salacious comments where e  er she goes . the other is got up to look like marilyn monroe . she has those sensual  slightly parted lips . and  not to give anything away  she is even more bad than the other .  br    br   all three sisters are played by starlets . the man who stumbles into their lives is played by john bromfield . he had something of a career .  br    br   this looks today like possibly the first mainstream soft  core porn ever marketed . well  of course not the first but the raciest at that time .  br    br   the girls wear as little as possible and let  s not forget about the female audience members bromfield is shown shaving with an electric razor   whose fetish was this    bare  chested . he also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuit .  br    br   there  s a real plot here  too the girls  family  see  is cursed . they are prone to suicide   or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicide .  br    br   the movie is not bad . i truly don  t know where it was shown . maybe it was made for drive  ins . somehow  and i could be wrong  i felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here . the women are scantily dressed . they often resemble lurid covers of mags like police detective or jackets of dime novels .  br    br   but the guy seems to be the central focus . not everyone in the movie likes him  but all the girls love him . and i think the audience is meant to also .  br    br   it  s lots of fun   and on its own terms  too .
