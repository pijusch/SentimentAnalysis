so when i was little i got this movie as a present and my sister and i loved it . we would watch it all the time . when our friends came over we would have sleepovers and we  d watch big rock candy mountain and grandpa  s magical toys . i  m   now and i still love this movie  some old friends and i recently got together and watched it  we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated profster when we were little . one friend actually bought this movie and grandpa  s magical toys for her  year old daughter because she wants to pass on our love of this movie . this really is a movie you can let your kids watch and feel safe  no violence  no bad language  just lots of great songs and important lessons .
