the haunted world of edward d . wood  jr . isn  t a particularly good documentary . aesthetically  it  s lackluster and cheap looking  the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in  cohesive  but this adds to it  s charm . i say this because it  s a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and  as such  there  s really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits . there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood  and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary . overall  it  s worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general  but don  t expect brilliance here . expect a documentary made after wood  s own heart .
