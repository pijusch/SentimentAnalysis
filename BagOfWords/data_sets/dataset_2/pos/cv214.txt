this review is dedicated to the late keith moon and john entwistle .  br    br   the original drum and bass .  br    br   there seems to be very little early who footage around these days  if there is more then lets be  aving it  now  a  days it tends to be of a very different kind of who altogether  a parody  a shadow of their  much  better years . to be fair  not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore  they  ve earned their respect and with overtime .  br    br   this concert footage for me is one of their best . to command an audience of around a        plus strong crowed takes skill  charisma  wit and a whole lot of bloody good music .  br    br   we all know of the other acts on the bill  the doors  their last ever show weeks before jim morrison died   moody blues  hendrix  taste  free and many more . the point being that whoever were there it was the who that the majority had come to see . this show was one year after the great hippie fest of the      s woodstock . the film and record had come out and so had the who  s greatest work to date  tommy . the ever hungry crowd wanted a taste  to be able to experience their own unique event  to be able to  grove and love  in the knowledge that this gig was their own . to do this you needed the best of what rock  n roll had to throw at the hungrily baited crowd .  br    br   at two  o clock in the morning in late august     the m . c . announces   ladies and gentlemen  a small rock  n roll band from shepherds bush london  the  oo  .  br    br   john entwistle  s body suit is of black leather  on the front is the out line of a human skeleton from neck to toe  roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long tassel  s and long flowing hair  keith in a white t  shirt and jeans  as pete had his white boiler suit and doc martins that he  d preferred to wear .  br    br   the who never stopped their onslaught of high energy rock for over two hours  performing theirs and other artists  greatest tracks such as young man blues  shaking  all over  and then as on queue  keith baiting the crowed to  shut up  it  s a bleeding opera  with tommy  the rock opera . the crowed went wild . this is what they had come to hear  and the who didn  t disappoint  straight into overture and never coming up for air until the final note of  tommy can you hear me   amazing .  br    br   to capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world was a fantastic piece of cinematic history .  br    br   the english dvd only comes in a soundtrack of english  linear pcm stereo  were as in the states  i think  you can get it with  .  at least   check local press for details  on that  okay .  br    br   the duration of the dvd is   minutes with no extras  which is a disappointment . yes  for a slice of rock and festival history this dvd would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play  for some of the best who concert footage as it was meant to be  live  raw and in your face   br    br   i would have given this dvd ten if it wasn  t for the lack of  .   and some extras would have been nice .  br    br   thanks roger  pete  john and keith .
