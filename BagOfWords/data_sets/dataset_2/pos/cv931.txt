i spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it . my husband and i enjoyed it so much we bought the vhs and have enjoyed it ever since .  br    br   the plot has been well  discussed  so no need in going over it again . the point is this movie deserves repeated viewings . americans  especially  aren  t going to get all the jokes the first time around . i know i didn  t .  br    br   this movie is funny  touching  sad   all at the same time . when ray proposes the toast at his daughter  s wedding  it  s cringe  inducing . when karen calls tony  brian  as he attempts to kiss her  it  s heartbreaking . when beano is finally cornered by the woman in black  it  s too funny for words .  br    br   and the music it  s as good as any movie soundtrack i  ve heard in years . i was dancing in the living room to  all over the world .   br    br   every performance is absolutely perfect . bill nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of ray  a man who has had one too many bad trips . stephen rea is perfect as tony  the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for karen all these years . he has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him . but all the actors are equally brilliant .  br    br   ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it . it  s a gem .
