as with all the other reviewers  this movie has been a constant in my mind after   years . i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story . i even wrote to the pbs station for more information . despite all this  all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the     s .  br    br   fastward to      after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was  a vhs copy of the movie . there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie . the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her . despite owning a copy  i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie . you can find it at http   www . johntopping . com  harvey   perr  war   widow  war  widow . html
