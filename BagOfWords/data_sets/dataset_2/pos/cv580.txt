this is a good adaptation of austen  s novel . good  but not brilliant .  br    br   the cinematography is inventive  crossing at times the border to gimmickry  but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring tv soap in costumes  given that the entire story is dialogue  driven .  br    br   the acting is competent . ms paltrow is aloof  as her character requires  but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions . in other words  she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match  making endeavours . some of the supporting cast is guilty of over  acting  very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures . personally  i had problems accepting alan cumming as mr elton  to no fault of his own  except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley  dolly in  the high life  that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part . acting honours go to toni collette who manages to radiate warmth  and jeremy northam who pitches his character at just the right level .
