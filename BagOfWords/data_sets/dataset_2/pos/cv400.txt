this is a docudrama story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at it  s impact on australian society . it especially looks at the problem of innuendo  gossip and expectation when dealing with real  life dramas .  br    br   one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations . not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis . just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so . this is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings . it  s an issue that has to be constantly addressed .  br    br   the leads play the characters with depth  personality and sensitivity . and they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based  on  fact individuals . some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors . it re  enforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals .  br    br    spoiler warning    br    br   i have to say something very personal here in that i am actually an ex  adventist who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most . i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality  and emotional heart . i think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers . it captured the themes of the story brilliantly .  br    br   i once heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to  play the best case for their character they could  . while this is especially apt for this story  i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well .
