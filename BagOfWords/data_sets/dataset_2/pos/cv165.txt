a sweet funny story of  people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings . the ex  cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting  even though they are marrying other people . maybe a little trite in that the  partners  are both type a personalities  while our protagonists are much more relaxed . not anything heavy  but it made me smile . and hey for the guys  sell the natasha henstridge angle  and the gals  sell them the sappy romance  everyone wins
