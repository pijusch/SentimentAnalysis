although super mario   isn  t like the rest of the games in the series  it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games . games with this much replay value are few and far between . plus  this game has so much variety . there are   levels each with several different tasks you can do  and many other hidden tasks . the game isn  t very challenging  but its lack of challenge doesn  t take away from the game at all . once you beat it  you  ll want to erase your game and start again . and its just as much fun the second time  or third time  or two hundredth time . a must own for any nintendo   owner  and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo   .
