i absolutely loved this film  i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it . i was completely enthralled through every second   br    br   i found the story gripping  the acting intense  and the direction spot  on . i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie . even though there was nothing  scary  about the story itself  i was soundly on edge through the whole movie  and for the rest of my evening .  br    br   i found that there were so many perfect choices made . . . the casting  the script  the little bits of humor sprinkled in it . there were so many points where the film could  ve gone for the cheap thrill  but it never did  and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately . . . and for the last number of years .
