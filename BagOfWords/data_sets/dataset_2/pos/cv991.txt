its a good thing i rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating from this site . it was a wonderful movie that i will be adding to my christmas selection . the cast was wonderfully chosen and ben affleck plays a good leading role . i would tell viewers who have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it . i rate it right up there with christmas vacation . the movie was very funny and well written and ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well . the things he says and does is just how i would imagine a person with too much money to act . the movie is much funnier than the santa claus and christmas with the kranks . plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of christmas which is you can  t buy love with money .
