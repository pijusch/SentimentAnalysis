i love the movies and own the comics  the comics are different then the movie but still i  d give it   out of   . it was awesome . if the movies got anymore awesome . i would have her babies . and i am female . read the comics you won  t regret it . yes in this movie since brian p . the artist for her died we don  t get nearly as good artistic work . i mean seriously don  t get me wrong these people did great  but different versions for different people . different strokes for different folks as the saying goes . any guy who doesn  t go bonkers over her is insane  or does not like women  or you know just plan insane . if i could count on my fingers how in love and how many times i have read the comics i would run out of fingers for sure  but hey there is always toes .
