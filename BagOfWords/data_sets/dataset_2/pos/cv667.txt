this is a very funny ealing comedy about a community in central london who  through an unusual set of circumstances  discover they are not english  but are an annex of the french province of burgundy .  br    br   the film features comic actor stanley holloway  best known as alfred doolittle in my fair lady   as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the period .  br    br   the story was apparently based on a news item at the time  when the canadian government  officially  gave a hotel room to a visiting european member of royalty . the idea actually reminded me of the real  life case of the hutt river province in western australia  where a landowner  seceded  from the australian government due to a wool quota dispute .  it was never acknowledged by the western australian or australian governments  .  br    br   this is a great script that plays with a lot of political and economic issues  rather like the tv show  yes minister   as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well .
