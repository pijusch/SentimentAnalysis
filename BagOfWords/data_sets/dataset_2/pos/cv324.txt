let me start out by saying i  m a big carrey fan . although i  ll admit i haven  t seen all of his movies coughthe magesticcough . bruce almighty was enjoyable . none of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets towards the end  i dont know what the writers were thinking . somehow i couldn  t help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at re  creating liar liar .  br    br   on a positive note  the daily show  s steve correl is hilarious and so is the rest of the cast . see bruce almighty if you  re a big jim carrey fan  or if you just want to see a light  hearted  que soft piano music  somewhat funny comedy .
