the french naudet brothers did something nobody else did  they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened . they were in building    when you could see papers drifting down  people hitting the ground from jumping from such a height .  br    br   i mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed they went running  their camera was still running  when the white dust covered them  they found a shop doorway and got inside  but all this footage is real and i think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us .  br    br   ten stars goes to the naudet brothers that filmed this extraordinary film that i watch every     so i  ll never forget what this country went through . i believe if i remember right  it shows the first death of the priest of the firefighters  while he was being carried to the church and his honorable funeral .
