  br    br   charlie kauffman has made weird metaphysical angst popular  but this canadian gem makes it hilarious .  br    br   like most weird films the less said about plot the better but let  s set the scene  two friends anthony and dave have been together since childhood  they can  t cope with the world and eventually this means they no longer have to . but that is where even more problems begin .  br    br   i loved this film  it made me smile long after the final credits and that is a rare experience with so many mass produced pieces of  nothing  out there .  br    br   don  t miss this .  br    br
