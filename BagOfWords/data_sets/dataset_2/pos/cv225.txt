i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating  s some people have given it . it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated  now if you don  t like comic books or animation then of course you won  t like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me . though  if you are a fan of interesting  strong characters and heroic  sexy  women kicking butt and saving the world  hell  you will love this movie . i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie . quite anime  esque or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation . like titan a . e . meet  s the live action version of punisher . in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie .
