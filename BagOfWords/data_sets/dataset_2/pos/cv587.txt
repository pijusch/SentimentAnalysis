by no means my favourite austen novel  and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress  but i found the film almost totally delightful . paltrow does a good job  and cummings  stevenson and the one who plays  miss bates  are all absolutely terrific . the period detail is not alienating the feel of the movie is just right  in fact . but the real  find  is jeremy northam as mr knightley . there could not be more perfect casting  imo . i hated mr k in the novel  but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film . northam  s good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment  either  highly recommended . anar
