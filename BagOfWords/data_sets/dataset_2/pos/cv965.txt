this movie is a little unusual in that it  s got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace . while this makes it pretty different from the average grant film  it is still highly watchable and entertaining . it  s sort of like someone said  let  s just follow cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed  . considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from myrna loy and melvin douglas  the film works very well . while the film has pretty modest pretensions  it makes the most of the material . it  s a great film for cary grant fans or for the whole family .
