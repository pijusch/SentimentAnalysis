i  ve just watched roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be . toby malone  s performance really stood out  i found myself actually caring about what happens to matt throughout the whole of the film  which itself is a lot of fun  very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters  quite an achievement considering it  s short running time . there are plenty of good twists throughout as well  it will keep you guessing until the end . other characters to watch out for are the totally insane tiny and the sneaky attractive jesse . it may not have the huge budget of a hollywood blockbuster but don  t let that put you off  you could do a lot worse than checking this out  you won  t regret it . good fun .
