this is a decent little flick made in michigan  about a guy that is haunted by his past  with his abusive stepfather  gunnar hansen  and has grown up not  so  well  adjusted . in fact  he  s absolutely bonkers  but tries not to be too obvious . he  s got an entourage too  his own little demon  angel that follow him around . the demon never says a word but really  doesn  t have to  and he  s max schreck  creepy . let  s just say that the angel pretty much spins his wheels in this  as eric is busy doing things that make him feel better  like  freeing  people that he decides need it  mostly beautiful young women . this is a decent portrayal of madness  and you  re kind of on your own at some point to figure out some of what  s going on  but overall  i watched this from start to finish very focused on the film because it definitely held my interest . it  s a little lacking in some areas but nothing i can really lay my finger on . a decent effort and worth seeing if you like serial killer flicks .
