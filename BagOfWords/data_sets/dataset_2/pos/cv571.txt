emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel . i have not read the book so i really didn  t know that much about the plot  and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot . there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing . the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved it . of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority was well acted and funny . gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma . the film also stars toni collette  who has okay but has been much better  ewan mecgreger  who has also been better but he is still very good here  alan cumming  who i have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here  and jeremy northam  who  s performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle  even if that was not what it needed  there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching .
