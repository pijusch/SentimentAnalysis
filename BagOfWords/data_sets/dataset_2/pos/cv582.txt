jane austen would definitely approve of this one   br    br   gwyneth paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of emma . she is funny without being excessively silly  yet elegant . she puts on a very convincing british accent  not being british myself  maybe i  m not the best judge  but she fooled me . . . she was also excellent in  sliding doors  . . . i sometimes forget she  s american    .  br    br   also brilliant are jeremy northam and sophie thompson and phyllida law  emma thompson  s sister and mother  as the bates women . they nearly steal the show . . . and ms . law doesn  t even have any lines   br    br   highly recommended .
