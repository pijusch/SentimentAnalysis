meryl streep is such a genius . well  at least as an actress . i know she  s been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents  but she nails the accent every time . her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring . mrs . chamberlain  as portrayed here  was not particularly likable  nor all that smart . but that just makes streep  s work all the more remarkable . i think she is worth all   or so of her oscar nominations . about the film  well  there were a couple of interesting things . i don  t know much about australia  but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story . i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago  but it came through loud and clear yesterday . and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery  inducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleagues . a pretty good film . a bit different . grade b
