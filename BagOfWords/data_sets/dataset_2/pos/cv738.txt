as a disclaimer  i  ve seen the movie    times in the last   years  and i only just saw the musical this week . this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn  t in the musical  however  it tainted me when i watched the musical     br    br   i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role  along with kasey . i think her  let me dance for you scene  is one of the best parts of the movie  a worthwhile addition compared to the musical . the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical  as well as the cast which is at least   times bigger  easier to do in the movie of course  . the decors  lighting  dancing  and singing are also much superior in the movie  which should be expected  and was indeed delivered .  br    br   the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie  the new ones are quite good ones  and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion  especially compared to a musical which has few decors . the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking  and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters  but their dancing is impeccable  and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical
