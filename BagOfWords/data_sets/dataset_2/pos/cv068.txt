one of the most heart  warming foreign films i  ve ever seen .  br    br   the young girl is an amazing talent . stellar performances by her  doggie   the old man  the king of masks   and liang  the living boddhisatva  .  br    br    spoiler  the deplorable treatment of children  especially females is disturbing .  br    br   loved the music . the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story .  br    br   this is a must see   enjoyable family film  although not for very young children . would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version .
