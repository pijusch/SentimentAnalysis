as is nearly always the case  when britain comes up with an entertaining and  or successful sit  com or quiz show  the yanks will come along and poach the format and produce their own  grossly inferior  version . man about the house is  of course  no exception to that rule . the yanks  version  three  s company  was unwatchable  braindead pap that seem to run forever . a prime example of quantity over  non  existent  quality . the original  on the other hand  is a fondly  remembered gem that had the savvy  like fawlty towers  to pull the plug at precisely the right time  unlike the    episodes of  hilarity  that three  s company came up with  . jo was cute  there was brilliant chemistry between the ropers  richard o  sullivan made it all look so easy  the scripts  whilst not exactly oscar wilde  standard  were consistently funny and chrissy was the most drop  dead gorgeous woman who has walked the face of this planet since the dead sea was merely feeling unwell .  nuff said .
