this movie was made in      but it still rings true today . very  very funny . it begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it  builds  from there . anyone who has ever built a house  will find this movie very endearing . great cast . cary grant and myrna lloyd are delightful in this film . this is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the    s . . . . clothing  architecture and family life . many references are made to the cost of things  and those comparisons to today  s costs are pretty amazing . i can  t imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely . i am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it . a true classic .
