this is a long lost horror gem starring sydney lassick   carrie  and others  and barbara bach . it is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it  s worth it . this film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time . it seems that  young newswomen  karen  vicky  and jennifer  travel to the small city of solvang  california to cover a festival when a mix  up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of earnest keller  lassick  and his strange wife virginia . vickie stays behind  feeling ill  as the other  are off to film their story . she is soon murdered at the house  in a very cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system  she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement  . soon karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover . jennifer is fighting with her  ex   lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home  her hosts  whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son  devise a plot to try to murder her as well . virgina does not totally agree with earnest  s plan to murder jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets junior . here the film turns almost comic as junior  portrayed hysterically by stephen furst  is a deformed  mentally deficient  manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though it  s supposed to be scary . this is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done . the actors  actresses do a terrific job with the material especially lassick  furst  and bach and although it  s not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining
