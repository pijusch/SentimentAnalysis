this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash  adorned in black  of course  who sings a lot and narrates a bit also . if you like johnny cash  this film is quite enjoyable . also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work . . . just for fun  try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair . . .  anyway  its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all .
