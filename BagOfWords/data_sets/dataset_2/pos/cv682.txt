three girls  an all  female media  crew  including cult  actress barbara bach  no less  visiting a small town to cover a festival  end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague . well  made little shocker  suffering a bit from some redundant dialogue  scenes and a rather thin plot  line  that doesn  t do very well in hiding its secrets  . one underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing  as in vintage shock  material   and this is basically what the film thrives on . performances  cinematography are pretty much above par  compared to many other late    s  early    s films in the same vein   but what really makes me recommend this film is the fairly long climax  scene in the basement  setting . from the moment that  keller junior  character was introduced  his performance made my jaw drop open and it didn  t close until the end of the film . a very pleasant surprise to see actor sydney lassick  who was funnily wacko in  one flew over the cuckoo  s nest   and now utterly demented in  the unseen   take on one of the leading roles .
