of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film . from that point of view it is utter fantasy . but who cares  it is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with citizen kane  battleship potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching . films like this are worth a hundred citizen kanes . it is about what cinema does best great camera  work  great settings and great performances .  br    br   the three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented  keeping the best till last .  br    br   i will gladly watch this film again and again and again and . . .
