meryl streep was incredible in this film . she has an amazing knack for accents  and she shows incredible skill in this film overall . i really felt for her when lindy was being persecuted . she was played realistically  too . she got cranky  upset  and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt . i didn  t expect much from the film initially  but i really got interested in it  and the movie is based on a real person and real events . it turned out to be better than i had anticipated . sam neill was also outstanding this is the best work i  ve seen from him  and i  ve really liked him in other movies  the piano  for example  . i gave the film a   but if i could rate just the acting  i  d give the it a  .   and a perfect   for streep .
