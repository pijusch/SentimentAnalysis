bruce almighty  will sweep the academy awards with a record   oscar wins  it will surpass titanic  as the highest grossing film of all time  jim carrey  s illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the     white house playoffs . almighty then  these grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers  carrey included  would possess the powers of god . that very same premise is the paramount ingredient in carrey  s new laugh riot bruce almighty  . carrey plays bruce nolan  a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds god to total culpability for his own contretemps . god  heavenly played by morgan freeman  grants bruce the gift of god   his powers  in order to challenge him if he can do god  s job any better . obviously  bruce gets carreyed  away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly . carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in bruce almighty  . jennifer aniston was not mis . pittiful  as bruce  s girlfriend . however  my premier kudos goes to director tom shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for    and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time  bruce almighty  is not the most in  depth carrey film  but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of carreyism    good
