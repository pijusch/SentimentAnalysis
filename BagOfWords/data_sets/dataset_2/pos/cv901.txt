this film takes you to another time when there was a different pace to everyday life . we get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight . a very touching look at the past and a reminder that casualties of war don  t just happen on the front .  br    br   luckily many of us have never had to go through what our great  grandparents  grandparents or parents went through during a war . this film  i think  is a small thank you . peter outerbridge looks amazingly like a young peter o  toole and russell crowe is absolutely charming and as australian as he can be . it  s definitely worth listening to him recite  high flight  and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with shakespeare .
