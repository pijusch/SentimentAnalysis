some years ago  satellite channel u . k . gold promoted repeats of  men behaving badly  with the hype  here it is  the original flat  sharing sitcom   . this was in fact untrue .  man about the house  was also a flat  sharing sitcom and ran from        .  br    br   it was the brainchild of johnnie mortimer and brian cooke  creators of the popular sitcom  father dear father  . when it ended  they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times .  br    br   in the first episode  chrissy  paula wilcox  and jo  sally thomsett  are tidying their myddleton terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath . he is robin tripp  richard o  sullivan   a southampton cookery student of no fixed abode . while his clothes dry out  he puts on a ladies  dressing gown and prepares them a meal . they are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay . but there must be no naughty business . so robin has to pretend to be gay . . .  br    br   on b . b . c .    s  i love       shown in      julie burchill claimed that  house  showed her a way of life she envied . she was not alone . one of the most iconic  for me  anyway  images of     s british television was sally thomsett coming out of the london underground carrying a parasol  and a  blind  man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings past .  br    br   a man living with two girls was a risqu subject for the time  but mrs . mary whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar  it was innocent  good  natured fun . mortimer and cooke  s scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it .  br    br   richard o  sullivan was still playing  bingham  in i . t . v .  s  doctor in charge  when this got started . in fact the second run of  in charge  overlapped with the first of  house  . he was born to play the sex  mad robin . paula wilcox  s  chrissy  was more streetwise than  beryl   her character she played in  the lovers   while sally thomsett  s  jo  was a lovable dizzy blonde . as time wore on  he became almost like an older brother to them .  br    br   for many viewers  brian murphy and yootha joyce stole the show as the warring ropers . george had lost interest in sex  but mildred had not . they went on to their own show  the aptly titled  george  mildred  . the late doug fisher was good value as as robin  s wideboy friend larry . he worked so well he was made into a regular .  br    br   within a year of its debut  there was the inevitable movie spin  off . i am not a big fan of the  man about the house  movie because i think it was stretched to fit the big screen . most of its characters had never appeared in the series .  br    br   the format was sold to america  where it became the long  running  three  s company  starring the late john ritter and suzanne somers . it was far more suggestive than the british original  with somers often seen in sexy clothing .  br    br   after six seasons   house  ended with chrissy marrying robin  s older brother norman  norman eshley  . fans were devastated to see robin failing to get the girl he loved  but there was some consolation in the fact that he too landed his own show   robin  s nest  .
