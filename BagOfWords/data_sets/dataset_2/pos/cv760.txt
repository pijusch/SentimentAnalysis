this film has a clear storyline  which is quite unusual to the musical genre .  cats    phantom of the opera   and other andrew lloyd webber  s musicals can be considered metaphorical  as they use literary works as their framework .  biarkan bintang menari   bbm   s storyline touches the very core of human relationships  especially that of indonesian people . despite the fact the film was based on a  supposedly  fairytale  it  s actually a fantasy of the  child  in indonesian adults . the dance sequences are not perfect  yet the songs represent how indonesians express themselves . i reckon the choreographer should explore indonesian way of dancing  by not dismaying the fact that indonesia  s dance development tends to be more westernized . the dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and not synchronized with the songs and  or music . yet  i still love this movie and regard it as a new wave of indonesian film genre which i hope to improve in the future .
