we watched this in my women  s health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies  and i absolutely loved this movie . i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch . the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone . i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed . this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating . this is a movie i will show to my children . the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women  but this movie was more than that . it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite .
