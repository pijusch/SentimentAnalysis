i like it because of my recent personal experience . especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite . the characters in the firm did not really enjoy their  real  lives  but they did enjoy themselves  i . e . what they were . the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory . a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city  but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life . many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those . before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way  which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film . before sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head . it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities . this made the conversations between the characters interesting  not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas . you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story . the end was not quite important after all . you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie . movies are supposed to be enjoyable . this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it . i am on a journey too . the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions .
