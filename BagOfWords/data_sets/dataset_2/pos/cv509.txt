i wasn  t expecting to be so impacted by this film portraying a family just like the one you  d expect to be living next door . they are ordinary flesh  and  blood people  not like the typical hollywood fare . they face an all too common problem   debilitating illness . but the story  line grips the heart with a powerful lesson . casting  script  direction  and acting flow together with a surge that draws the viewer deep into the story . give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire .
