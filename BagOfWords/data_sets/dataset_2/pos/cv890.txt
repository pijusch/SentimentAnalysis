honestly  when i saw this movie years ago i immediately wanted to turn it off . as i sat there for the next   minutes or so  i realized that the actor playing navin stole the show . his facial expressions and comedic demeanor makes me shake my head as to why he hasn  t been in more comedies . he has this  marty feldman  thing going for him but much  much more talent . . . taking nothing away from marty . the movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original jerk  but then again  it was so much more . i really think that if this movie was released first  and i saw the steve martin movie  nd  i  d think the  nd was a cheap rip  off . i know it sounds like a bold statement  but it  s true . i actually like steve martin a great deal  but his performance is  nd to the actor in the jerk too . i wish i could get a copy of it for my collection . i urge you to see it if you can find it .
