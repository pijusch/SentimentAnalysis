the problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the    s  created concept that comic books could only be done as  camp   i . e .  the    s batman show  for tv and movie . thus you have combat sequences with subtitles  come on    a cluelessly unromantic doc savage  he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps  not an idiot   monk mayfair in a nightsheet  a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights   and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a herve villechez posing for an oscar statute . and when they  re not doing booming sousa march scores  the tinkly little  funny  music undercuts much of the drama .  br    br   even as such  this movie is . . . okay . it  s fun  and when it stays serious it  s a very accurate representation of the pulps . except for monk  as has been mentioned before he  s hugely muscled  not obese . and long tom  who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude  not paul gleason with an  inexplicable  scarf .  br    br   the green death sequences  for instance  are remarkably gruesome and not something i  d recommend for children . but they are very close to the feel of the pulps . when the writers and producers get it right  they do get it right  i  ll give them that .  br    br   but if the producers had done doc with the loving care and scripting of  say  reeves  first two superman movies  think what we might have had then . i think the problem is the movie  s schizophrenic . there  s a definite sense of trying to do a    s homage  but they  re also trying to give in to the  heroes must be camp  attitude that batman created . one gets the impression there was a sober  pulp  style first draft and then someone came in and said   hey  let  s make it funny  it worked with the batman show  years ago    br    br   but doc lives on  thanks to earl macrauch and buckaroo banzai . if macrauch ain  t doing a homage to doc savage in that movie  the man is truly demented . so when the series actually gets on tv  allegedly mid  season in         doc savage  updated to the    s  will live once more .
