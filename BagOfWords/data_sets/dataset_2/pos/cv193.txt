this was another world war ii message to the soldiers and to the allies to be careful about spreading rumors . these were called  instructional  cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny  looking main character called  pvt . snafu .   br    br   all of us have imaginations  along with fears and what  have  you  and that  s what happens here as pvt . snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with  five .  you can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them . that includes losing confidence in your country and your cause  as pointed out here in this cartoon . a good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy . that  s still being done today .  br    br    we lost the war   declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon . amazing how some americans still haven  t learned . this cartoon may be   years old but it sure has relevance today . as i write this  there were two terrorist bombings in europe today and some people still think the  war on terror  is just a bumper sticker slogan . amazing .  br    br   the writer  the famous  dr . suess   uses analogies of  hot air balloon juice  here to present the above message . with theodore geisel  his real name  you know the rhymes will be clever .  br    br   nothing hilarious here  but it wasn  t meant to be . you have to understand the climate of     and the justified paranoia that was out there during world war ii . people forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning . it was a tense time
