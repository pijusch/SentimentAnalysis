forget the campy  religious  movies that have monopolized the television  film market . . . this movie has a real feel to it . while it may be deemed as a movie that has cheap emotional draws  it also has that message of forgiveness  and overall good morals . however  i did not like the lighting in this movie . . . for a movie dealing with such subject matter  it was too bright . i felt it took away from the overall appeal of the movie  which is almost an unforgivable sin  but the recognizable cast  and their performances counteract this oversight .  br    br   definitely worth seeing . . . buy the dvd .
