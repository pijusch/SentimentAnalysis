the fact that this film was put out on dvd still formatted  to tv and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists . . . . . . and rightly so . this deserves a lot better treatment .  br    br   the story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft  the rules of the day  and winds up with a little girl instead  not the conventional way  . . . . and the problems that ensue afterward . the old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy  which he obviously thought was the case .  br    br   the old man  bianlian wang  xu zhu  is kind of funny  looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin . the little girl  doggie   zhou renying  is a cutie . the rest of the story is how the two manage after that . i usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final   minutes .  br    br   overall  it  s involving story complete with drama  suspense  humor and sadness . just don  t expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the dvd . until it comes out on widescreen  rent it .
