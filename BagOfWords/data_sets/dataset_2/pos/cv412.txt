this is an extremely  powerful based  on  a  true story film that can be infuriating to watch . i say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people  in this case an innocent australian couple charged with killing their baby .  br    br   meryl streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but i thought sam neill was just as good . let  s just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for streep because she had to learn an australian accent .  she learned it so well i had trouble understanding her in parts .   br    br   without giving anything away  all i can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally .
