to those who say that this movie deserves anything below the unflaunting grace that it showed  i disagree . this is an amazing documentary about a shocking day .  br    br   imdb asks us to rate this movie . i beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made . the courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable . we find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened . they continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own and eachother  s safety . to judge whether it  s nobler to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save the lives as those amazing  amazing firefighters did is not mine to answer . i just know that in   years  a class full of children will not know one without the other .  br    br   i submit a wholehearted   . this is why the art of filming was created  to capture the natural emotion that real life offers . you can keep your kung  fu junk . romance is cute . action will never reach this level . this movie       will be timeless in that it did not glorify itself . it didn  t have a sneak  peek . it didn  t have all of the blatant vanities that a lion  s share of the many movies on the many screens blare . it had class  composure  substance  and it had a record of the day that changed the modern face of america and even the world . it spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera . please consider this movie  as it itself proclaims  a stirring tribute to all of those who fell because of the free  beautiful name of america .  br    br   how can you give anything less to a movie that shows  not embellishes  the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times . i love  the godfather  but       is forever a different kind of movie as this is now a different kind of world . it is art without question or questions .  br    br   jf
