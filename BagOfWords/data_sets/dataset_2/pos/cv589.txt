what a delightful film . . .  br    br   accompanied by oscar  winning composer rachel portman  s lush  emotional and dreamy music  this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year .  br    br   incredible casting . . .  br    br   gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma . toni collette was great as harriett smith .  br    br   the character who stole the film was miss bates    she was mesmerizing to watch  one finds oneself on the edge of ones  seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her . one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages . from one of the opening scenes when she is thanking mr . woodhouse for sending  that lovely quarter  hind of pork . . . pork  mother     she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired mother  mrs . bates  played by emma thompson  s mother  phyllida law  who looks forlorn and lost .  br    br   the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut  wrenching scene at the picnic when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart . we then see poor miss bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one  s heart ripped out to her on her behalf . it is a classic scene  one to be rewound and played over  over . . .  br    br   the ending is right up there with  sense  sensibility  and provides one of life  s greatest lessons about how one should marry one  s best friend . . .  br    br   i hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself .  br    br   i adored it
