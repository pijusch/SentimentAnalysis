this isn  t as violent as i was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective .  br    br   there are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who  s side a particular character is on .  br    br   the plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the triad gang it follows .  br    br   the violence when it comes is brutal  no guns or martial art scenes with special effects  this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the triad is a violent criminal organisation .  br    br   the ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable .
