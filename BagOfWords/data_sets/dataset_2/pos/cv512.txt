a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie . it  s based on a novel of the same title  which was equally good  though different from the film . really made you think about how you  d respond if you were in the shoes of the characters . recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent  spouse  or family member   in other words  everyone   br    br   though the production isn  t quite hollywood quality   no big special effects   still  the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it . and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members  and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill .  br    br   you don  t want to miss this
