this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last harem of the ottoman empire  well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone  and learn about the people who lived there .  br    br   i enjoyed the story  characters  acting and scenes . a few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly  otherwise a wonderful piece .  br    br   the main character safiya is played wonderfully by marie gillain who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it . the scenes with her and alex descas  nadir  are charming and lovely .  br    br   i recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating .
