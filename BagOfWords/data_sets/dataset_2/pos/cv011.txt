i liked the film . some of the action scenes were very interesting  tense and well done . i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it . a very tense action scene that seemed well done .  br    br   some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography  unusual colors  or interesting angles . also the film is funny is several parts . i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too . i  d give the film an  out of   .
