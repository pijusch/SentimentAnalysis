i nominate this and babylon  as the best television sci  fi series made . both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series  there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters . if you look at the original star trek and star trektng  they were fine shows  but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes . in many ways  you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring . this was less the case with deep space   with its giant battles that took up all of the final season  and the other trek shows  as there was more of a larger story that unified them . this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon  and saw this to an even greater extent with sg   . the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form . sure  there were a few  throwaway  episodes that were not connected to the rest  but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny .  br    br   and speaking of funny  i loved that sg   kept the mood light from time to time and wasn  t so dreadfully serious . in this way  i actually enjoyed it more than babylon  . jack o  neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson   it  s really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons .  br    br   to truly appreciate sg    you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work . this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power . and  if you don  t like sg   after giving it a fair chance  then sci  fi is probably not the genre for you .
