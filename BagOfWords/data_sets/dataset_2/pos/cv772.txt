every time i see nicole i like her more . i love a movie like this . a woman you just won  t give up on  but she keeps breaking your heart . first movie i remember seeing like this was of human bondage  the kim novak  laurence harvey version . the beefs about the correctness of the russian spoken in this film are petty  it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can  t speak russian  i  m sure . funny how people miss the point . the no  goodnik russian guys were well cast too . finally  i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin  as somebody else noted  he plays a sap with great dignity  and there was definitely some heat between him and nicole . to think  guys get paid for that  mind  blowing .
