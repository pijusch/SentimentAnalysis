i appreciated the photography  the textures  the colours and often  unlike one comment  the lighting . what was lacking for me was a coherent storyline . i found it often disjointed  badly edited and at times difficult to follow . my version was    minutes  imdb shows one at    m . possibly the cuts and subtitles didn  t help . i applaud any films that escape from the hollywood mould but this left me disappointed . miss gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine  i just wanted a little more dialogue . if anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one  try  hideous kinky  with kate winslet .
