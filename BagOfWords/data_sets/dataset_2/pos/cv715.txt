the second of the why we fight series concentrates on hitler  s grab of the sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of neville chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of europe .  br    br   clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the  allied bias  turning out to be historical fact . the fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves east . the czechs and austrians quickly capitulate but the poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds .  br    br   the disparity between hitler  s military might and chamberlain waving the munich treaty like a white flag  declaring  peace in our time  to this day has durable propaganda qualities . here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of world war ll sets in on europe leaving the american viewer with two options  freedom or slavery . in     there was no evading this simple truth and the nazis strike makes its point effectively .
