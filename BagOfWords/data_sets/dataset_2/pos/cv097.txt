elephant walk       starring an early peter finch as lord of the manor in some god  forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad englishmen  staying out in the midday sun and going berserk . well eventually they do  after the typhoid or cholera outbreak  of course  and much mayhem ensues . taylor replaced an ailing vivien leigh in this pot boiler  adventure flick . when the elephants storm the house and trap liz on the grand staircase i still get goose bumps . thank goodness dana andrews is around to save the day . one of my favorite guilty pleasures . in color too
