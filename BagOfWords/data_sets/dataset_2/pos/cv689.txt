upon the first viewing  i found this tale to be at least less annoying than other cannon movie tales . after many more  i think it  s one of the best . some of the songs are pretty bad  especially the love song  but two things stand out that make the movie  even the singing  worthwhile . one is the art direction . like the other cannon movie tales  this is a beautifully decorated period piece every piece of cloth and jewel  both of which have major parts in this movie  s plot  look fresh and new  and contrast with the plain clothes of the peasants . even during the love song i find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess  wonderfully done . the other thing is the comic timing . a lot of the movie is cheesy  but the emperor  s vanity  and his making fun of himself in the end   the suspicious guard  the guard chasing nicholas  and the stupid prince  were all quite funny and seem to be ridiculous quite on purpose . and the sequence during the song weave  o makes up for the songs that weren  t so good .
