a small funny film . it is totally incredible  unbelievable  impossible . but it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized  even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms . of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the internet . you must not believe ten percent of what you  re told there and never  ever  ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally . most of their  businesses  there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you . but here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive  he is absurdly silly . but then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning . one think is sure too . security in english airports is not exactly what it should be  but i guess it  s not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically . then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage  a real plague on modern airports  and don  t expect to get fair compensation . or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous . i can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener . funny  isn  t it  dr jacques coulardeau  university paris dauphine  university paris  pantheon sorbonne  university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
