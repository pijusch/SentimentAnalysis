i have no idea how a texan  the director  douglas mcgrath  and the american actress gwyneth paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about ms . paltrow was in the first place  i had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her oscar  winning  shakespeare in love  performance but she gets all the beats right here   she is nigh on perfect as emma woodhouse . she may have won her oscar for shakespeare but she should be remembered for this .  br    br   of course  she  s surrounded by a great supporting cast including toni collette  greta scacchi  juliette stevenson et al . . . jeremy northam is very appealing as the love interest  even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to paltrow  in the process  allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship   several years on  ewan  s hair is a little easier to take than it was in    and  personally  i find puckish alan cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays . but the standout is  without a doubt  sophie thompson  sister of emma thompson  daughter of phyllida law  as miss bates what this version needs is a scene where emma reconciles with miss bates  as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn . the film is worth watching  again even  for her performance alone .  br    br   all in all  this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the british class system . well worth a rental  because its unlikely that paltrow will ever be this good again   but we  ll always have emma  .
