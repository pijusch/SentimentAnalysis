to my surprise i quite enjoyed  spacecamp   i remember seeing it about   years ago  and recently i hired it again . i was quite impressed . obviously the special effects in todays space films such as armageddon and deep impact are far superior to those in spacecamp . however  this film had a story  a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it . but thats what i liked about it  they don  t make films like this anymore  so it was a refreshing change . it was interesting to see kelly preston  leaf phoenix and lea thomson in early roles  with tom skerrit and kate capshaw to add substance to the light  fluffy plot . absolutely loved the robot named jinx  it was very cute  but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters . the film was almost inspirational in its own way  and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the nasa spacecamp in alabama  i think  .
