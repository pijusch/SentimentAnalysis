what another reviewer called lack of character development  i call understatement . the movie didn  t bash one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary backstory . yes  there were many untold stories that we only got a glimpse of  but this was primarily a one  day snapshot into an event that catalyzed change in all of the characters  lives . henry thomas  s performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action . good rental .
