spoilers this is a gripping movie about grifters . but who is conning who here  when does the hunter turn into the prey  this gritty  dark movie is slow moving and seductive . it pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path  only to waylay you just as you think you are safe .  br    br   it has a riveting script  with good acting  at least from the leads  . i didn  t notice the background music  but it was never jarring  so it must have been done right .  br    br   i was very surprised that i liked this movie  because i don  t usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end .
