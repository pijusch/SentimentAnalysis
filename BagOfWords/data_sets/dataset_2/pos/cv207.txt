well  i  ll be honest it is not exactly a sholay . but you cant get a sholay every week . in fact  you could see distinct signatures of  not without my daughter   sally field       in this movie . however  as most  inspired  movies go  this one was a well  inspired one  well handled and well done . nana patekar  as usual  tends to overdo his hysterics  but all others are commendable . specially so about dipti naval saw her after a long time  but she hasn  t lost any of her grace . in fact  she has performed much better that when i last saw her . another one of the bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age   br    br   all in all  a nice watch .
