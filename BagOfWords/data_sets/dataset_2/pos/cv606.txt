i chanced upon this movie because i had a free non  new release from blockbuster and needed to grab something quickly  as the store was getting ready to close for the evening . the plain white cover and title intrigued me . i  m a  relatively speaking   old  lady and my son is a young man of   . i adore movies that are sheer entertainment  such as the sixth sense  interview with a vampire  harry potter and beetlejuice . my son  on the other hand  is a film graduate and enjoys very specialized foreign films  such as those directed by bergman or hertzog . we generally hate each other  s movie choices  however  we both watched and loved the movie nothing  it was unlike any movie we  d ever seen before . we  re both cynical  critical personality types and we usually crack on movies while we watch them   but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the film from start to finish . it is our opinion that if this movie had been promoted and shown in the main stream theaters in the u . s . it would have done very well indeed .
