there are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime  but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives . these once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don  t meet these people anymore . we don  t always even know their names  as we are never presented to each other  and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are . it  s funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such  because reuniting might spoil fond memories  or we don  t know do they . we are too afraid to check that out .  br    br   the movie  before sunrise  just caught me watching it . i never had intention to watch it through  but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting  i gave a look for the rest of the film . i didn  t know what to expect from it  but nor did the young couple . they had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate . i believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through . it makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives .
