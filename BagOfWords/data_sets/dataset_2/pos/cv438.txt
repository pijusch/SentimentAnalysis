a fantastic arabian adventure . a former king  ahmad  and his best friend  the thief abu  played by sabu of black narcissus  search for ahmad  s love interest  who has been stolen by the new king  jaffar  conrad veidt  . there  s hardly a down moment here . it  s always inventing new adventures for the heroes . personally  i found ahmad and his princess a little boring  there  s no need to ask why john justin  who plays ahmad  is listed fourth in the credits  . conrad veidt  always a fun actor  makes a great villain  and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves  who at one point finds a genie in a bottle . i also really loved miles malleson as the sultan of basra  the father of the princess . he collects amazing toys from around the world . jaffar bribes him for his daughter  s hand with a mechanical flying horse . this probably would count as one of the great children  s films of all time  but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays . kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when abu and the genie are on screen together . and the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful . although most of the younger generation probably thinks that king kong looks bad at this point in time  willis o  brien  s stop  motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn  t even look remotely like a spider .     .
