there are a few spoilers in this comment    br    br   contrary to the comments i just read by nativetex  u and a few others  i really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series .  br    br   i am a judson mills fan but also a huge chuck norris fan and while i  ll admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little  the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being aired .  br    br   the opening fifteen minutes with deke running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed . i do fail to see how that many  professionals  weren  t able to hit a moving target  but the action was definitely there and deke  being the hero  had to survive .  br    br   as for the comment about needing to  get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the playoffs .  this movie was not originally scheduled by cbs for a january airing and filming was completed in may of      a good  months before the terrorist attacks against the u . s .  br    br   if the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it  maybe they would have realized the plot of the story rashid  a bin laden like character  planned to set off a nuclear device in the united states . the president  s man was called in to locate and eliminate the problem .  br    br   perhaps the writer should actually watch the movie before attempting to comment on it .  br    br
