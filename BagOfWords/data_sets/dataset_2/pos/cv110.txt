fact stargate sg   is a cheesy sci  fi tv series .  br    br   there  s no escaping facts . how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg   remains a cheesy sci  fi tv series .  br    br   stargate sg   does borrow and steal ideas briskly . special fx aren  t nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn  t going to blow you out of the chair . or couch for that matter either .  br    br   but  and this is where i really think stargate sg   deserves all the credit it can get  for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci  fi movie that  s actually worse than a one hour tv episode .  br    br   in fact some episodes actually could probably have been   minutes long and still have been better than most movies .  br    br   and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg   special .  br    br   i am very picky with my selections . i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught .  br    br   so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg   as yet another tacky sci  fi show  don  t . stick with it and you  ll see what i  m talking about .
