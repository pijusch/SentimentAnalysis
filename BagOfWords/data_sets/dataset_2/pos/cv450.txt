this film  was one of my childhood favorites and i must say that  unlike some other films i liked in that period the thief of bagdad has held on to it  s quality while i grew up . this is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children  it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well . the only drawback there is  is that one can not see past the bad  effects  compared to the effects nowadays  like one could when one was a child . i remembered nothing of those effects  of course it had been about ten years since i  d seen this film  when i was about eleven years old . who then watches effects  one only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides . in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the   th century . coming to think of it i feel like the indiana jones films are quite a like this film . there is comedy  romance and adventure all in one  which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern  it succeeds in not being dusty and old . all of that is mainly due to the great story  the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors . in that department sabu  as abu  and conrad veidt  as jaffar  stand out  providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part . great film and although an  oldie   definitely a goldie  . i hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on dvd someday .  br    br    out of
