definitely needed a little work in season  . such as the virus between max and logan  and ames white along with his ancient  super cult . during season two  however  the only thing that kept me watching was to see if max and logan would ever get rid of the nasty virus infecting max . very good drama in season two . but of course like all tv shows  if there  s something a little wrong with it  the broadcasting company takes it off the air . i was seriously hoping for a third and final season . season  leaves you hanging  unless you read the books by max allan collins  then you will know what happens .  br    br   dark angel should be put back on the air for one more season even though it might cost a lot just to get all the original actors again . since jessica alba  s carrier sky rocketed after the show . if that would be the case  then there should be a movie to complete it . just like the show firefly  which of course fox canceled as well .
