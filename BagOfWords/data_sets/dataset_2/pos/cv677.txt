dark angel is a cross between huxley  s brave new world and percy  s love in the ruins   portraying the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order  both in the worst sense of the word . once one swallows the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a standstill by  the pulse   it provides an entertaining landscape for exploring the personalities of and relationships between the two primary characters   max  the dark angel  bike messenger  and logan  the rich rebel  . it seems uneven  perhaps a result of a variety of authors  but is held together by the energetic  beautiful  and charming jessica alba  who seems both strong and calloused yet vulnerable and sensitive . i think that fox has done it again .
