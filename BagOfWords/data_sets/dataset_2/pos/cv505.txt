this has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy  meets  girl movies ever made . while  rebel without a cause  and  say anything  deliver nice portrayals  this movies strips down useless subplots and hollywood divergences . this movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance . you never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people . you almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between jesse and celine  and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it . this movie is mostly all dialogue  based . but  every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing . what makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is . how in all that conversation  while often having no real bearing on anything critical  you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other . this is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone . and what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe . this could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random . and what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of vienna in which this film takes place . it just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests . and no matter how many times i watch this film  i don  t think i will ever tire of that .
