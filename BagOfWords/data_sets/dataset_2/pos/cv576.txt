i  m a huge jane austen fan and besides being a feature  length film  a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a mini  series  it was really great . gwyneth paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but well  intentioned rich girl and jeremy northam is mr . knightly with his poise and nobility . i wasn  t thrilled with ewan mcgregor even though i like him very much as an actor but didn  t feel it spoiled the movie at all . like i said  as a jane austen fan there were things i would have liked to have seen included that weren  t but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was i felt they really encapsulated the story well . i  ve seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one
