wow . . . what . . . a whirlwind . the    s is a decade with plenty of movies of every type i can imagine  especially during the early talkies phase . there were movies which are painfully static and dull  like  dracula  with bella lugosi  and there were those that just don  t give it a rest  sometimes in a good way and other times not . this is one of the films that don  t stop for a minute  and that is both a wonder and a pity . lloyd bacon  who also directed    nd street   must have been the king of the depression era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema  for he filled this picture with it . there mustn  t be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking . it  s completely crazy  i was thinking the movie deserved a   or a   tops  because the pacing was very poor  since it was insanely fast and i sometimes didn  t know what was happening and what to think . the characters seemed to just running to and fro places  talking about things which didn  t interest me and probably no one else . i thought i was just going to be rewarded with a small headache . i noticed lloyd bacon also cast the female lead in    nd street   ruby keeler  and    nd street  was a movie whose ending was the best part of it . and you know what  it happened the same thing with  footlight parade   the ending is absolutely incredible  it has become  hands down  the most impressive musical i have ever seen . the final part presents us some musical numbers and those are  believe me  something that make seeing the other rest of the movie worth . the numbers are flawless  there are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second one . suddenly the screen was filled with gorgeous and inventive camera work  beautiful people and plain entertainment that made me forget my small headache .
