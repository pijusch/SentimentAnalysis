excellent show . instead of watching the same old sitcom type shows where it  s the same old thing  just different  stars   this refreshing show provided an incredibly entertaining view of office situations . we have been away from watching any television for  years and after coming back  of all the shows available we look forward to watching this show on w . shame on global for pulling the plug on this one . i thought this one would be a winner . let  s be realistic about things  few canadian shows make it . everyone i talk to enjoys this show and i believe it was foolish of global to walk away . i guess they want to stick it out with the typical mind numbing shows from the states instead of pulling behind a canadian made show that had a lot of promise . don  t get me wrong  i enjoy a lot of shows on tv  but  come on people  let  s keep the variety . this unique show provided a very comedic view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships  with unique characters that you don  t see on any sitcoms today or in the past . too bad that global had to say no to this one  foolish mistake .
