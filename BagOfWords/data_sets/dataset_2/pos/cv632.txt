how anyone can say this is bad is beyond me . i loved this show before i even saw it . for  reasons   . the story intrigued me   . jessica alba and  . james cameron  please ignore the bad comments and please watch the whole first season before you decide that it  s bad because i know that if you watch the first season you will love it and go out and buy season  as well as season  on dvd and then join the campaign to get season  made   br    br   i hate fox and i  m sure a lot of you  dark angel  fans hate them too . they have a thing for canning good shows  don  t you all agree
