it may  or may not  be considered interesting that the only reason i really checked out this movie in the first place was because i wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out humphrey bogart in his casablanca       role for the best actor oscar .  i still would have given the oscar to bogie  but paul lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination  at least .  well  i  m glad i did check this movie out  because i enjoyed it immensely . i think the movie did preach a little  but not only did i not mind  i enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them .  br    br   the acting was outstanding in this movie . i especially enjoyed paul lukas  lucile watson  rightfully nominated for an oscar   bette davis  wrongfully not nominated   george coulouris and  oddly  eric roberts  who plays the middle child . i really enjoyed his character an odd  looking boy who talks like some sort of philosopher . he just cracks me up . even the characters name  bodo  is funny .  br    br   the ending  in which lukas  s character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons  worked for me as well . i agreed with why he felt he had to what he did  and i understood why he couldn  t quite explain it . the message this movie makes is a good and noble one  the scenery  meaning the house  is beautiful  and the acting is the excellent . watch this movie if you ever get a chance .  br    br
