this is a film for entertainment i did not think the world made social commentary from one small film . i personally find this film funny  audacious  and memorable . it is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a princess . this film was done very well i might add  in the    s a time of the best experiments in film with being able to mention a person  s sexuality . this movie is not about a person being homosexual or not  it is however about love  in all it  s strange forms . this film does show some of the realities of being gay in the    s in hollywood  or in california . pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men . women who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career . bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community .  br    br   then the fantasy begins   let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have  well this movie  which in any way was better than that dismal redo  the next big thing  . perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better .  br    br   i enjoyed this movie when i saw it in the    s and it still brings a smile to my lips now . i heartily advise anyone who wants a funny  tender movie  to curl up with some popcorn and have some fun . some people need to lighten up    and this is the film you should do it with   br    br
