this is a true story of an australian couple wha are charged with murder when their infant child disappears . meryl streep is excellent  as always  and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isn  t particularly likable .  br    br   the media frenzy that surrounded this case in australia is reminiscent of the sam sheppard murder case in ohio during the    s . these real  life situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled . i well remember the cleveland plain dealer running a huge headline stating  why isn  t sam sheppard in jail   . the prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure  and sheppard was tried and convicted . only after years in jail was he exonerated .  br    br   i love movies which tell a true story  do it in an interesting way  and make an important point in the process . this is one of those movies . other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include  hurricane    the thin blue line   and  breaker morant  . in particular  the latter is another australian film which is highly recommended .  br    br
