i  ve spent years looking for a copy of this film    mm  dvd  vhs   so i could show it to my kids . the movie is funny  and spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business . they had to be that good to play that demented . i like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages .  br    br   the movie is about a turn of the century firehouse  with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band  when not fighting the fires  . there  s the usual running gags  plus the mayhem of spike jones and his orchestra . also  comedy relief provided by comedian buddy hackett and straight  man hugh o  brien .
