teresa pavlinek was a popular member of the toronto second city cast . she has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in canada . finally someone has the sense to create a show for her . the supporting case seems quite good too . i have now watched the pilot several times and i still find it refreshing . though  i am not sure why the show is listed as the jane show     .  i might be wrong  but as far as i am aware  the show was conceptualized in     and appeared on global tv in canada in early     . it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well . too bad this couldn  t be paired up with corner gas . now i know corner gas is on ctv  but the two shows would be great companion pieces .
