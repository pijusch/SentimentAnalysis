i am a very big jim carrey fan . i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura . i also like him in his serious movies  especially truman show . this one is a cross between his very funny side  and his serious side . he is of course very funny in this movie  but there are parts that are very serious  and he pulls it off with a lot of ease . he is truely a multi  function actor .  br    br   as for the rest of the cast  i was happy with jennifer aniston  s acting . i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass . morgan freeman makes a very cool god . as for steven carell  his limited scenes are very funny  especially in the anchor scene .  br    br   overall  i would have to rate this a  . good acting  funny script  and some very serious situations make this a very good film .
