i was a little skepticle if i should watch this when it was first shown on cbs . i was one of the many people who were in nyc on that day  i was going to school at hunter college . i didnt want to see all the devistation and carnage again  but like many i was curious to see what this was all about . tears came to my eyes watching this documentary . all my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable . i bought the dvd on the one year anniversary and watched it a few times . how these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible . if you have not seen this documentary  do yourself a favor and check it out . it is obviously depressing and will bring tears to eyes  but it  s an incredible document of this countries darkest hour .
