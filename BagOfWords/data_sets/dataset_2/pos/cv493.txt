sweet and charming  funny and poignant  plot less but meaningful   before sunrise         the third movie of richard linklater  is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love  is in love  or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it . it is one of the very rare movies that is  should  will be equally interesting to teenagers  their parents and even grandparents . it seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects  car chases  or long and steamy sex scenes . two young people in their early   s  two college students  american tourist ethan hawke who is returning home after the summer in europe and the french student julie delpy who goes to paris to attend the classes in sorbonne  meet on a train . they are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking  they hop off the train in vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night . they talk and fall in love . that  s it  that  s the movie . it could  ve been boring and silly but instead  it is a lovely  believable  clever  and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing  at least  for this viewer  . high praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters  superb writing  always interesting and witty dialogs  two awesome performances  and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is . julie delpy  who looks like a botticelli  s angel  is great in portraying smart  independent  and incredibly attractive young woman .
