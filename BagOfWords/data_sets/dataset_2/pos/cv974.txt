personally  i enjoyed cut thouroughly . it was the first time i  ve seen a theatrically release australian slasher flick . a genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood films .  br    br   with all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of australia i loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that wasn  t a rip off of anything . i didn  t even think it was really a spoof of other movies . it was a supernaturally theme horror like nightmare on elm street  not scream or i know what you did last summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief . i think it  s about time australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genres .  br    br   cut was original  scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun . i  d give it seven out of ten and wouldn  t treat it as anything serious . it did what i expected it to do  entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying . i enjoyed it .
