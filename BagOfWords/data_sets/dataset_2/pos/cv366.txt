a message movie  but a rather good one . outstanding cast  top to bottom . interesting in that bette davis  s plot line is essentially back story  the extremely negative reviews  name throwing at the screenplay  playwright  associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about  angles in america   etc . etc .  object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii . gosh  that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me .  br    br   theatrical and movie  making  and acting styles vary over time and of course   years later this particular movie would not be made in this way . yes casablanca is a better movie  i guess   but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them  casablanca is primarily a love story . the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot   more of a thriller . both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors . the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited
