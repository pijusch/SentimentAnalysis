the first and second seasons started off shakily  with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones  and at times resorting to clichd stories . but once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop it  s characters more  it became a lot more fun and entertaining .  br    br   the main reason this show succeeds it because of four men richard dean anderson  peter deluise  joseph malozzie and paul mullie . richard  s dry sense of humour makes to show so much better  peter  s directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining  and joe  paul never fail to make a funny  interesting episode together .  br    br   once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters  i doubt you won  t like the show . for those getting into the show i suggest the episodes  the other side   a good serious episode  and  window of opportunity   a classic comic relief episode .
