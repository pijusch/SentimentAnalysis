yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award  material . but then it doesn  t try to be anything it is not . a fun  filled romp with real funny one  liners  a stellar and very funny performance by peter o  toole  a grounding and down to earth performance from joan plowright . the band  s performance was on the spot  each one playing their role in a deft  comical manner . the music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely . from some of the negative comments i deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads . a good example is the comment about the  strange baseball  like game   well my dear american  that was cricket  from which baseball is derived  and the explaining of it to the ignorant us band was very funny for those that do know cricket . also no  you were not supposed to wince when carl broke a window it was funny how lord foxley said  oh yes   to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time  oh no  also referring to the money . jeez  it seems that every joke must be explained to some people . . . all  in  all i enjoyed it and had some great laughs  well worth seeing .
