this movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam  whether financially or emotionally . you will definitely laugh  which is the best medicine    left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies  grace has to find a new way to make some money and it  s not exactly legal which adds to the humour . even my boyfriend liked it so don  t think that it  s a chick  flic .
