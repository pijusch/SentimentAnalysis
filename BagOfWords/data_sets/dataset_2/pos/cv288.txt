my rating refers to the first  seasons of stargate sg   which are wonderfully fresh  creative and addicting . when the cast stepped through the gate  you never knew what lay on the other side  starting around season   the show took a different focus  still good  but different .  br    br   the series follows the adventures of a team of humans  and one alien  who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the  stargate  . the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie  stargate  in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt .  br    br   the episodes are light  innocent and easy to watch  and very creative . many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci  fi movies of their own . what happens next was always unpredictable .  br    br   the characters on which the show rests are also well  defined and brilliantly performed . their tone is serious  but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor . they are simply fun to watch .  br    br   starting somewhere around season   the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe  the goa  uld  then the ori  . the plots become more complex  a lot more political  strategic oriented  and interdependent . the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature .  br    br   one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the    th and    th episodes . they are simply can  t  miss shows . they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through   seasons .  br    br   if you are a sci  fi fan  watch a few episodes of the first  seasons and you  ll likely be hooked . if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides  you have   seasons of shows to look forward to .
