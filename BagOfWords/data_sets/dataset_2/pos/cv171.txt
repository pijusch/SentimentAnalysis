this is the first michael vartan movie i  ve seen  i haven  t seen alias  and i was curious to see if the guy can act . he sure can and is likable in this movie . natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles  so i found her very good and lovable in this different  sweet  role of a schoolteacher . some of the negative comments i read are true  the movie is full of clichs and the story doesn  t ring true at all . also  even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together  i don  t think there is screen chemistry there . however  i enjoyed this movie . the locales are nice  the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good . if you are expecting to see a great romance  this is not it . but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good .
