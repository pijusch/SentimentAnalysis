i  m watching this on the star world network overseas which buys american and canadian series that last one or two seasons like the jane show . i thought of how many female lead comedy shows im actually able to watch on my own  there  s lucy  bewitched  i dream of jeanie  the one with barbara feldman   and then my mind goes kind of blank i cannot think of any others  the women are all supporting roles not the lead . so for me  the jane show is in pretty good company . one thing i just thought of though . i  ve watched several things made in canada  and i never recall any thing being filmed in a regular tv series that shows snow  it  s all made at the height of summer  lol  granted it  s a great place to live climate wise in the summer but you would think  they would show a little bit of canada in the winter since that  s part of the lifestyle there also . i mean sctv  just for laughs come to mind as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in canada and very little or none is shot with snow present even though they both do a lot of outdoor shots . i digress but i kind of chuckle at jane and her obviously liberal ways being accused of racism to her neighbor  and i like the bald guy and his craziness  i found it on par with a uk series called the it crowd  i think  another office comedy with a female lead . not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alone  thats saying something . if i was with my wife she might really enjoy it since it addresses sex in the office and stuff like that so might be a good light comedy for couples to watch .  of   .
