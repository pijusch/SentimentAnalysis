what  s with all the negative comments  after having seen this film for the first time tonight  i can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person  s day . when i saw that drew  ben affleck  might end up spending the holidays alone  i wanted to cry . you  ll have to see the movie if you want to know why . also  even though i liked tom  james gandolfini  and alicia  christina applegate  after awhile  if you ask me  they were real snobs . however  this film did make me smile and feel good inside . before i wrap this up  i  d like to say that mike mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit . now  in conclusion  i highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person  s day to any ben affleck or christina applegate fan who hasn  t seen it .
