yes . . . i  m going with the    on this and here  s why . in the last few years  i have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late fees because the movies were that easy to forget . then i stumble upon  nothing  . looked interesting  wasn  t expecting much though . i was wrong . this was probably one of the funniest movies i have ever had the chance to watch . dave and andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember  but not over complex to the point of missing the joke . i don  t want to remark on any of the actual scenes  because i do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once . with more and more pointless concepts coming into movies  you know  like killer military jets and  fresh  remakes that are ruining old classics   this movie will make you happy to say it  s ok to laugh at  nothing  .
