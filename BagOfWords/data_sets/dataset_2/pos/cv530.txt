  br    br   this is definitely a  must see  for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hide  out  trying to avoid being caught by parents  teachers  the police  etc . . . the protagonist is a lady in her forties  living in her mansion  breeding orchids  and absolutely unaware of the fact that her so  called rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheating on her . when he all of the sudden dies  she is confronted with the truth . the bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt . she doesn  t know what to do  until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in britain . she decides after some long thinking to get rid of her flowers and start breeding pot instead . . . the story is quite original  the performances outstanding  i can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than this one . still  the melodramatic touch is present . the film is typical british the jokes aren  t vulgar  there is no violence involved . it shouldn  t be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken a few draughts before watching  saving grace  . it will be so much more fun  especially the scene with the  old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious . i thought my jawbones would burst .
