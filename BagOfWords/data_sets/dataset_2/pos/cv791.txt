this movie is best described or compare to  big fish   the movie by tim burton  . but it  s a less glamorous and more in you face tale . and of course here it  s not the father  but his grandfather who tells the stories .  br    br   the movie  s narrative also moves back and forth  so the story outline here at imdb  might tell you more than you would like to read  before watching the movie  . it  s funny and engaging enough  even though you get from one story to another and have some dramatic moments too . it also surprises you here and there  with things you wouldn  t expect . a nice little movie then  that deserves your attention  especially if you like movies like that  o
