the only time i have seen this movie was when i was   years old . i have remembered it all of these years as i couldn  t sleep for a week or more after seeing it . it just absolutely rattled me . i was on vacation with my aunts in ft . worth  texas and i will never forget it . now    years later  my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to view as an adult . it has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was but i always remembered that barbara stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and reviews on it . i very much enjoyed it  but it gave me quite a scare  jaqui
