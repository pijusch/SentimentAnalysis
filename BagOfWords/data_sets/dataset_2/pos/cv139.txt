this movie is the first of miikes triad society trilogy  and the trilogy kicks of to a great start . the movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically  and these themes are actually apparent in all his films  if you look close enough . shinjuku triad society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders  struggling their way to the top of tokyos yakuza . the kid brother is a lawyer  and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one  as the movie progresses . the movie takes place in a very harsh environment  and is therefore pretty violent and tough . miike has done worse  but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard . as usual there is also a lot of perverted sex  mostly homosexual in this one . the movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie  but with a great drive and true grittiness . if you  ve only seen miikes far  out movies  ichi the killer  fudoh etc .  this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over  the  top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side  as seen in the other films of the trilogy . and as always with miike  there are at least two scenes in this that you  ll never forget  see it and figure out which ones for yourself  .  br    br
