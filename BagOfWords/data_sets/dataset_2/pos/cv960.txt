this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety . those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film strides .  br    br   it is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you aren  t familiar with hong kong films  then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one . i was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made story  wise but overall a good crime film . some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the east .  br    br   people just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior . it  s a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film .
