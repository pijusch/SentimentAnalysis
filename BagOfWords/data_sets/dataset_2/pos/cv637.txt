this is a wonderful film . the non  stop patter takes several watchings to fully appreciate . the musical productions of busby berkeley will never be duplicated . i think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts . joan blondell and james cagney are incredible together . some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of today  s movies . put rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is .
