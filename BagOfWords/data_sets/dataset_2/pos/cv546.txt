i saw saving grace right after it came out on video . since then it  s become one of my favorites  the plot isn  t particularly complex but it doesn  t take away from the entertainment . it  s chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it . the characters are what makes the movie so good . they each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor  the two old ladies played by linda kerr scott and phyllida law leaps to mind . superb acting was done by all  particularly brenda blythen . she and craig ferguson were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments . if you  re looking for a good comedy i  d definately recommend this movie
