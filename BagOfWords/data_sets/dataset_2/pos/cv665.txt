i love this show  it  s sure to be a winner . jessica alba does a great job  it  s about time we have a kick  ass girl who  s not the cutesy type . the entire cast is wonderful and all the episopes have good plots . everything is layed out well  and thought over . to put it together must have taken a while  because it wasn  t someone in a hurry that just slapped something together . it  s a great show altogether .
