i had few problems with this film  and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated . true  it is over three hours long  but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly . i don  t think it is overrated at all  i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent . the film looks sumptuous  with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects  and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus . leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack  and kate winslet is lovely as rose . david warner  a great actor  steals every scene he  s in . the story is very rich in detail  and is hot on character development  obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be  though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow . the last hour is extremely riveting  and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat  when the titanic sank . i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving . the music score by james horner was lovely  though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on . the     miniseries was good  but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies . overall  i give titanic an  .     . bethany cox .
