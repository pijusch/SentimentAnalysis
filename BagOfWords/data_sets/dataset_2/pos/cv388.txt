i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in      though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness . the film is set in       just before the entry of the us into the war . paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family . he  s a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture . bette davis is his very understanding and long  suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time . as the film begins  they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years  they are going to relax and stop running .  br    br   the problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent   making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems . while this had a very noble goal at the time  it just seems phony today . in particular  the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn  t ring true . it sounded more like anti  fascism speeches than the voices of real children . they were as a result extremely annoying   particularly the littlest one who came off  at times  as a brat . about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the scumbag romanian living with them  though he had no discernible accent  .  br    br   it  s really tough to believe that the ultra  famous dashiel hammett wrote this dialog  as it just doesn  t sound true to life . the story was based on the play by his lover  lillian hellman . and  the basic story idea and plot is good  . . . but the dialog is just bad at times . overall  an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments  . . . but that  s really about all .
