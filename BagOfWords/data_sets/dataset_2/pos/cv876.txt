coinciding with the start of the baby boom  the years after world war ii saw an unprecedented exodus of americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes . directed by h . c . potter and co  written by norman panama and melvin frank   white christmas    this lightweight but surprisingly observant     screwball comedy captures the feeling of that period very well . of course  it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs  cary grant  myrna loy and an especially acerbic melvyn douglas  head the proceedings with their natural likability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership . even though the film is sixty years old now  there is a timeless quality to the blandings  dream and the barriers they face in achieving it . obviously  hollywood thinks so since it  s been remade at least twice  first as a very physical tom hanks comedy       s  the money pit   and again last year with ice cube  s  are we done yet   . one look at hgtv  s programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today .  br    br   the plot begins with ad man jim blandings  his wife muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom  one bath manhattan apartment . rather than pursue muriel  s idea to renovate the apartment for        jim sees a photo of a connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move . with the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend bill cole  the blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair . however  the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one . this sparks the blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first . costs rise with each new complication  tempers flare  and even a romantic triangle is imagined among  jim  muriel and bill . priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the not  so  blissful ignorance of the new homeowners .  br    br   with his double takes and flawless line delivery  grant is infallible in this type of farce  and jim blandings epitomizes his more domesticated mid  career characters . in a role originally meant for irene dunne  myrna loy shows why she was hollywood  s perfect wife . she doesn  t get many of the funnier lines  but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make muriel an appealing character on her own . watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette . as avuncular  pipe  smoking bill   colebill cole    melvyn douglas shows his natural  easy  going lan as grant  s foil . smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by harry shannon as the laconic well  digger mr . tesander  lurene tuttle as jim  s officious assistant mary  and louise beavers as the blandings  lovable maid gussie . the     dvd provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie  the first a     version that did end up pairing grant and dunne and then a second     version coupling grant with his then  wife  actress betsy drake . a most appropriate     cartoon   the house of tomorrow   is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house . the original theatrical trailers for ten of grant  s film classics complete the extras .
