the unseen is done in a style more like old hollywood mysteries than a horror show . the film is somewhat slow but lots of bizarre imagery keeps it the film alive and watchable . the basic idea of young girls stalked by something in the basement is old  but good acting and production make the movie worth watching . the movie is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects . i rated it an  out of   .
