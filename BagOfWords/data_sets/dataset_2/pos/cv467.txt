the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza . he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer  paired with dorothy kirsten  soprano of the metropolitan opera . indeed  i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso  check a  vuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini  . the mgm art and music departments also did a good job . this movie could be perfect  were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth we see that she is trying her best  dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before      unforgivable . lanza deserved a better leading lady  and blyth should stick to less demanding productions . also notice that ms . kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza  giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano .
