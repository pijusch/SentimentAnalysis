my parents took me to this movie when i was nine years old . i have never forgotten it . i had never before seen anything as beautiful as elizabeth taylor .  she was twenty  two when she made elephant walk  remember  i  m nine  so the feelings aren  t sexual  i just couldn  t see anything else on the screen . i just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her . she has begun to show her age   she  s almost seventy  four  but i still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have lived .  br    br   i have seen the movie several times since  and it is a sappy melodrama . what saves it is  of course  miss taylor  s beauty  magnificent scenery  the very impressive elephant stampede  and a well  made point on human arrogance in the face of nature .  br    br   all in all  a well  spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video .
