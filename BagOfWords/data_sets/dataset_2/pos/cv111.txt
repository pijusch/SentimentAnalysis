scott bartlett  s  offon  is nine minutes of pure craziness . it is a full  frontal assault of psychedelic  pulsating  epilepsy  inducing flashing lights and colours  and the first true merging of film and video in avante  garde cinema . there  s no story to speak of  but bartlett uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions  integrating these biological phenomena into the highly  industrial form of modern technology . in a sense  the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools  his machinery  his technology . this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal     in stanley kubrick  s       a space odyssey         and  indeed  bartlett  s opening sequence of images  flashing colours before a close  up human eye  recalls dave bowman  s journey through the stargate . the visuals are richly  coloured  a confronting blend of sharp  vivid photography and increasingly  grainy video  as though we  re sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact  the end product was recorded from a tv monitor .  br    br   there appears to be some confusion about the film  s release date . imdb lists the film as a     release  but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give     as the correct year . perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film  s completion and its first public screening . either way  the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time  occasionally reminiscent of a     s music video  and some brisk techno music wouldn  t have gone amiss  either   offon  captures grainy  fragmented images  presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information . i had a thought  and please don  t laugh at this free  thinking interpretation  that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earth  s television signals might very well receive such a disjointed  alien documentation of human life  a bizarre montage of only vaguely  familiar imagery that couldn  t possibly make any coherent sense . perhaps this is where mankind  with all his technology  is eventually heading  towards an irreversible merging of film and video  of purity and artificiality .
