musings pure delight from beginning to end . not a laugh riot  but a more subtle  sophisticated humor . what a goldmine of great scenes and character actors  including reginald denny  nestor paiva  ian wolfe  harry shannon and jason robards sr . .  br    br   cary grant is at the building sight of his new home  which is at that point  being framed . a young carpenter  played by future tarzan lex barker  asks him if he wants his  lallies to be rabbeted   or some such thing that only a carpenter would know . grant  not wanting to appear ignorant  replies in the affirmative . at that  barker yells up to his mates   ok boys  he wants  em rabbeted  so . . . . yank  em out   a second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about   big nails being pulled out of various boards . all grant can do is moan .  br    br   yes  the movie is dated . you  d never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home  and a place like that  in connecticut of all places  would probably run a few million bucks .  br    br   a classic movie that is really a treasure .
