i can  t understand what it is that fans of the genre didn  t like about this film . it was truly a lot of fun . the special effects were wonderful . i generally agree with reviews and with imdb voters  but not this time . i waited until it came to home video which i felt was another reason that i wouldn  t enjoy the film . i believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen  but again this was not the case . to me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time . blair witch and the mummy . both films that i thought were terrible . blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time . the mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck . people liked it for it  s special effects . films like the mummy and the haunting are not rich in character development  they are more like funhouse rides . well with that analogy the mummy was a b ticket to the haunting  s e  ticket .
