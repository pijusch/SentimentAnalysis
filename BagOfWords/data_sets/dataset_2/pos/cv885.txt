first saw this gem from joe sarno way back when  and i must say that after seeing it  i could never forget jennifer welles . at first i thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a sarno film  but when jennifer made her entrance  the first time i ever saw her anywhere  i was sat up and took notice . her presence in this film is hard to avoid  and spices up every scene she  s involved in . i  ve seen most of the rest of sarno  s films  and the other films starring or featuring jennifer welles  and i must say that this was both sarno and jennifer at their collective best . sarno  s direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb  and jennifer showed  figuratively and literally  an acting prowess that make this a must see . co  stars rebecca brooke  aka mary mendum  and chris jordan  both frequent co  stars of ms . welles  and also frequent stars of sarno  s work  turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous  yet normal housewives . this film is sarno classic .
