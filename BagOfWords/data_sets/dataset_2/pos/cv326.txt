jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennifer aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this     season  late may  and a good improvement on carrey  s past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies . with a slightly toned down carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self  carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic  tearfully somber moments . elements of jim  s real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie . this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons  including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script . while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy  drama  bruce  almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good  natured taste . eight out of ten stars .
