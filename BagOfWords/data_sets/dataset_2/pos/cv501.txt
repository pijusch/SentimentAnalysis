  before sunrise  is a wonderful love story and has to be among my top  favorite movies ever . dialog and acting are great . i love the characters and their ideas and thoughts . of course  the romantic vienna  introduced in the movie does not exist  you won  t find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night  and it isn  t possible to get to all the places in only one night  either  especially if you  re a stranger and it  s your first night in vienna  . but that  s not the point . the relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic . although  nothing ever really happens  the movie never gets boring . the ending is genuinely sad without being  titanic  or something . even if you don  t like love stories you should watch this film  i  m a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer . the first part is perfect as it is  in my opinion .
