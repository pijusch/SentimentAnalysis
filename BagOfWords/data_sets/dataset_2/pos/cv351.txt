remember these two stories fondly and in the first  set in the not too distant future  we see a young boy preparing for examination day  the state i . q test . the boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test . upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why . the examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth . the boy then asks  puzzled again  why wouldn  t he  it is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry  but their son  s i . q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial . a corker of a concluding scene  a message from charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present . which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present . a nice story with a heartwarming conclusion .
