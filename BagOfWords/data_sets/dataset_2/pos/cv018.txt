if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing . the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery  and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about . however  there is not much tension  and williams  mild mannered portrayal doesn  t do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy .  br    br   collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear . the production felt rushed and holes are apparent . it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort . the book is probably better .  br    br   one thing is certain taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort .
