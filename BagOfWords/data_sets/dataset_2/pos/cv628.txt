never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by cagney and the other cast members namely dick powell   scott blair  who had a great tenor voice and ruby keeler   bea thorn  . james cagney plays the role as chester kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theater  s during the      s . chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows . this is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs . joan blondell   nan prescott  gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty . dick powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career . enjoy .
