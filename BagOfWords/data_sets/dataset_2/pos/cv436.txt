let  s cut a long story short . i loved every minute of it . a lavish fantasy in true arabian  nights style . there  s an evil magician  a pretty princess  a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after . modern hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic . only quibble the special effects are pretty dated  loved sabu with the djinn  s foot  though
