i must admit that i was very sceptical about this documentary . i was expecting it to be the kind of all american propaganda that we here in europe dislike so much . i was wrong . this is not propaganda  in fact it is hardly political at all .  br    br   it depicts the events of     through the eyes of the firefighters called to the scene just after the planes crashed . it is an amazing coinsidence that this documentary was filmed at all  this film was initially shot as a documnetary about a rookie ny firefighter becoming  a man  . we can only thank the film makers that they continued their work during the terrible ordeal that faced them .  br    br   a great piece of work . absolutely stunning material . highly recommended .  br    br   regards
