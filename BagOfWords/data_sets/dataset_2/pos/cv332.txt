i would have rated the series a perfect   for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season     br    br   the final episode of the   th season  unending   where  it would certainly appear that  the asgard have been killed  off in a very rushed  unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion  left me in disbelief   br    br   from the extremely rushed end of the series  it  s obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season . my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg   franchise for the two upcoming direct  to  dvd moves   br    br   unless the asgard return in a future sg   movie  with a very good explanation of the  apparent  extinction   i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean  up of loose  ends   br    br   poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci  fi series .
