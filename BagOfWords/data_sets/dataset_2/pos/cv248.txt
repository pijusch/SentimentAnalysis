some spoilers  br    br   i was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms  acting  dated dialogue  unclear storyline  unfounded . belafonte is great as a brandoesque  menacing  swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill  equipped from his past life to do so . he learns too late how empty his hustling  materialistic life was without love . mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife fanny . in spite of his prayers for a miracle  his bitterness prevents him from accepting  or believing  in one . the two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other  the result being hilarious and touchingly sad .  br    br   the perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film . after looking everywhere for belafonte  mostel looks up to see a falling feather  and he frantically reaches for it as if he  s finally willing to believe in angels and miracles . but belafonte wasn  t allowed to finish his miracle  either to restore fanny  s health or mostel  s faith   so he never got his wings . the feather floats tauntingly out of mostel  s grasp  a metaphor for both men  s live it  s too late and you don  t get a second chance . like  it  s a wonderful life   this movie is magical  wonderful  funny  but terribly tragic .
