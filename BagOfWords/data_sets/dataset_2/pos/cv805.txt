space camp is a pretty decent film . the plot is predictable  but the actors do a good job  and the special effects are decent for the time .  br    br   this film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster  and that really put a hamper on how popular it was .  br    br   the scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular . . . on the big screen  that is . . . on a tv . . . it just looks average . i remember this scene in the theater . it made you feel like you were really up there .  br    br   this would be a good film to see on imax  but i  m sure that will never happen .
