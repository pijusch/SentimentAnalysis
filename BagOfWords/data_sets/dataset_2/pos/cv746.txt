anyone who has seen this movie and reviewed it poorly  i would refer them to roger ebert  s review of this movie . he is one of the most respected critics in the industry  and he gave it     stars .  br    br   this is a great movie . it may not be perfect  or spectacular  but i enjoyed it . a chorus line is not so much a story  as it is a group of stories about the lives of broadway hopefuls . i read reviews where people said that too much time was wasted on the romance between zach and cassie . that is an incorrect view . it is another story along with all the other stories that are told about each of the broadway hopefuls . what people fail to realize is that those who are dancers for broadway shows go through the same things that the common man goes through . and that i think is really the point of the whole show . it is to showcase not only the talent of these special dancers  but to give us some poignant things to think about in regard to life in general . this is a study of life as a broadway star . anyone who has dreamed of becoming a broadway star watches this movie with a great feeling of relationship because they have gone through exactly what the characters are going through .  br    br   this is a great musical . it has its slow points  and at times gets a little confused with the pacing of certain story lines  but all in all  i thoroughly enjoyed it . take a closer look at the movie  and then maybe you will understand what i am talking about .
