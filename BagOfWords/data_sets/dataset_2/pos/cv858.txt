i would reccomend this film to everyone . not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue  but to all film  buffs . because it  s sincere  moving  funny and true . because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover  and every frame of his film is made with love and care . because his characters are loved and ask to be loved . because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one  done by an outsider  is a real joy to watch and to listen at . because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza  who was  like freccia  beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin  that ligabue shows as it is  unglamorous and ugly  without indulging in easy moralisms . because it  s a film that speaks to our heart  our ears  our souls . and because i lived the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that . thanks  luciano
