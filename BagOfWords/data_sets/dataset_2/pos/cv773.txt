modern  original  romantic story .  br    br   very good acting of both nicole kidman and ben chaplin .  br    br   miss kidman does a nice job in imitating a russian accent . ben chaplin is also good as the shy  dull clerk . for the men  and some women   miss kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic . i forgot what a gorgeous woman she is . it  s not hard to imagine that john falls in love with her . some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense . although i hoped for a happy ending  the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me .  br    br   conclusion  good movie .  br    br   les pays  bas  huit points .
