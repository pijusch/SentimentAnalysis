here  s an excellent barbara stanwyck double bill on one disc . the first movie  and believe me the lesser of the two  is mgm  s  to please a lady        in which she is paired with clark gable . it is essentially a star vehicle with gable as usual dominating the film with his screen presence . here he plays a macho racing driver who gets some bad press from feminist reporter stanwyck and the battle of the sexes begins . of course after much ado they eventually end up in each others arms and it all comes to a predictable and pleasing close . a bit of a fluff of a move really but gable and stanwyck  two icons of the golden age  make it watchable   br    br   but the real meat on this dvd is the second feature  a marvellous and quite unknown little thriller called jeopardy . produced by mgm in     this is a wonderful little gem of a movie that hasn  t dated one iota  here stanwyck plays the wife of barry sullivan and mother to their young son lee aaker on vacation on a deserted and remote mexican beach when suddenly tragedy strikes . a dilapidated wooden pier collapses trapping sullivan under a heavy pylon and guess what  yes  the tide is coming in . with not a soul in sight and unable to free him herself stanwyck sets off by car for assistance . after driving some distance the only aid she can muster comes from an unscrupulous escaped convict  ralph meeker  who  in return for his help  wants more from her than money or a change of clothes   i  ll do anything to save my husband   . does she or doesn  t she   .  br    br   meeker runs away with the picture  he turns in quite a brilliant performance  once he comes into the film you simply cannot take your eyes off him  an actor in the smouldering brando style he surprisingly never made much of his career in films . although he gave splendid performances as the unsavoury  disgraced cavalry officer in the outstanding mann  stewart western  naked spur        and as one of the doomed sacrificial french troopers in stanley kubrick  s powerful ww  drama  paths of glory        his only real claim to fame was as mike hammer in mickey spillane  s  kiss me deadly  in     . his performance in  jeopardy  should have done wonders for him but he had only a so  so career in films . he died in     .  br    br   because of this release  jeopardy  can now proudly take its rightful place as a classic noir . a memorable  taut and exciting thriller thanks to fine performances  tight direction by john sturges  the crisp monochrome cinematography of victor milner and an atmospheric score by dimitri tiomkin . extras  however are no great shakes except for a radio version of  jeopardy  and trailers for both movies .  br    br   this disc is also part of a barbara stanwyck box set celebrating her centenary . hard to believe that the lady would be over    years old if she was still around   br    br   jeopardy  an mgm winner
