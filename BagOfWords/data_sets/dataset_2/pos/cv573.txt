  emma  was a product of what might be called by the first great jane austen cycle of the mid  nineties  and it was recently shown on british television  doubtless because of the interest in the author created by the second great jane austen cycle which started with  pride and prejudice  two years ago . we currently have in the cinemas the austen biopic  becoming jane   and itv have recently produced three tv movies based on austen novels . these include  northanger abbey   the only one of the six major novels not to have been filmed previously  so the cycle should now be complete . no doubt  however  there will be more to come in the near future .  there is  after all  her juvenile  love and freindship   sic   the short novella  lady susan   and someone  somewhere  has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments  the watsons  and  sanditon  . then there are all those austen sequels churned out by modern writers  .  br    br   the main character is emma woodhouse  a young lady from an aristocratic family in regency england .  not  as some reviewers have assumed  victorian england  austen died before queen victoria was even born  . emma is  financially  considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price  and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband . instead  her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends . she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer  robert martin  believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton . this scheme goes disastrously wrong  however  as elton has no interest in harriet  but has fallen in love with emma herself . the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards  with good reason  as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself . this being a jane austen plot  emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems  and she too finds herself falling in love  leading to further complications .  br    br   emma always insists that she will not marry without affection  and when she does find a partner  the handsome mr knightley  we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate marriage . it does not  however  seem likely to be a very passionate one  unlike  say  that of elizabeth bennett and mr darcy  . knightley  who is sixteen years older than emma  she is    he     and related to her by marriage  is more like a father  figure than a lover . much more of a father  figure  in fact  than her actual father  a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather . when emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend miss bates  it is knightley who chides her for her lack of manners .  his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature  nineteenth  century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry  . both gwyneth paltrow and jeremy northam play their parts very well  but this is not really one of the great screen romances .  br    br   of the other characters  i liked juliet stephenson  s vulgar mrs elton and toni collette  s harriet . i know that in the novel harriet was a nave young teenager  whereas here she is more like the character collette played in  muriel  s wedding   a gauche  slightly overweight twentysomething  fretting about her chances of finding a man . nevertheless  i felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not detract from austen  s themes .  br    br    emma  is one of austen  s more light  hearted works  without the darker overtones of  mansfield park  or even  pride and prejudice   and this is reflected on screen . we see a world of beauty and grace  full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners . apart from the ruffianly gypsies  who make a very brief appearance  the only  poor  people we see are mrs bates and her daughter  and  as they live in the sort of picturesque rose  strewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over          we can be sure that their poverty is relative  not absolute . in emma  s world  poverty is defined as not having your own stately home . this is  of course  not a comprehensive picture of early nineteenth  century life  but nobody has ever claimed austen as the regency equivalent of a kitchen  sink realist . sophisticated romantic comedy  combined with a keen eye for analysing human character  was more in her line .  br    br   i would not rate this film quite as highly as the      sense and sensibility  or the recent  pride and prejudice   it tends to drag a bit in the middle  although it has a strong beginning and strong ending  but it is  in the main  a highly enjoyable austen adaptation .
