i have to say i totally loved the movie . it had it  s funny moments  some heartwarming parts  just all around good . me  personally  really liked the movie because it  s something that finally i can relate to my childhood . this movie  in my opinion  is geared more towards the young gay population . it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up . all the taunting  name  calling  and not knowing is something i  like most other young feminine boys  will always remember  and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay . so  i would definitely recommend seeing this movie . probably shouldn  t really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
