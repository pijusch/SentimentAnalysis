from what critics and audiences indicated  birthday girl had to be a big fat clinker . still  because i love nicole kidman  i decided to rent it last night . it proved to be quite worthy of watching . sure  it isn  t your basic american comedy  and it doesn  t take a genius to realize that it is a very british movie  but that  s why i liked it . it was a change from all the other movies around  a breath of fresh air . sure  there were some plot holes  but overall it worked . first off  kidman was fabulous again in a very different  not very glamorous  but still quite sexy role . she just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in hollywood . not only is her russian accent when she speaks english effective  but there are times when she carries on long conversations in russian and if you didn  t know it was nicole kidman  you would never question her authenticity . harrison ford should have taken note in  k    .  overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz .
