i disagree with anyone who done  t like this movie .  br    br   i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do . it  s sweet  funny and warms your heart . and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed .  br    br   and even though it didn  t have much of a story  it was still excellent i give it a   and two thumbs up .  br    br   oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wish  s and dreams can come true .  tear  tear   br    br   i love this movie  personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say  shame on you .  because it was a delightful little movie and i  m glad that at least some people liked it .
