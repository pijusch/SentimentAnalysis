well it  s been a long year and i  m down to reviewing the final film for     . panaghoy sa suba  call of the river  placed second in the recent metro manila film festival . as expected  it didn  t do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since mmff is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies .  br    br   it was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in filipino or english play out in the screen . i thought cesar montano did a good job both as a star and director . his great vision and creativity really helped this film . he was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film . also performing well was young actress rebecca lusterio . she did a great job portraying bikay  the younger sister of duroy . i hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres . i think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her .  br    br   some of the camera shots in the film were done very well . the scenery was made breathtaking even though i feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different .  br    br   in terms of the story i feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film . i certainly won  t be raving about the story of this film .
