roll is a wonderful little film . toby malone plays an   year old kid  very well acted  by the way  who is into soccer . malone  s cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym bags  a drug lord  some tough bikers  some cops  and some prostitutes . . . and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law  what the contents of either gym bag is  and even what gender a key biker is . parts of it reminded me of lock stock and two smoking barrels .  br    br   for me  roll reinforced three opinions that i already held before seeing roll . those opinions are  . i really want to visit australia one day . the country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a cool place for a vacation .  br    br    . some of the best filmmakers in the are australian . the cinematography in roll was especially impressive . i loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes .  br    br    . australian women are hot
