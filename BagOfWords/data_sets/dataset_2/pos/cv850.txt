a thin story with many fine shots . eyecatchers here are the three ladies from the d . r . e . a . m . team . and  to a lesser extent  the guy accompanying them . traci lords convincingly acts out the female half of an evil business  couple intending to poison the world with antrax . original in this movie is the bra  bomb  put on a captured member of the d . r . e . a . m .  team . of course she is rescued by a co  member  three seconds before explosion . although clearly lent from james bond  s  goldfinger  and  you only live twice   such a climax always works well . all in all a nice watch  james bond replaced here by three charlie  s angels .
