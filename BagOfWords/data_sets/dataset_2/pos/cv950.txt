british comedies tend to fall into one of two main types the quiet  introspective  usually romantic study and the farcical social satire . settings  characters  and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories . butterflies is perhaps the epitom of the first type .  br    br   the scripts are very verbal  including long interior monologues by the main character ria  a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life . when she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman  who makes his interest in her quite clear   she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered .  br    br   the acting and scripts are always on the money  which makes one  s reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one i was neither blown away by it nor turned off . my mother  on the other hand  adored this show . i think the degree to which one identifies with ria  s dilemma is the most important factor in determining one  s reaction to butterflies .
