i  ve always enjoyed seeing chuck norris in film . although the acting may not be superb  the fight scenes are fantastic . i also enjoyed seeing judson mills perform along side him . in my opinion  the norris brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production  i hope you take the time to view this movie
