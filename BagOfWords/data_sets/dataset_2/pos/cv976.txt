there is so much to love in this darling little comedy . anyone who has ever built or bought a house  or even just been short of space  will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled mr . blanding . melvyn douglas  with great comedic flare  both narrates and acts as the blandings  attorney and voice of reason . as well myrna loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife . but the best performance is grant  s . he is the american everyman  especially relevant at the time of this film  s release  when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war . the themes are universal  lack of money  work strain  fear of infidelity . yes  it does wrap up awfully neatly  but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war  and wanted a happy ending . it is still relevant today  and i must chalk up the poor reviews i see to a present preference for dumbed down  gross out comedies . the look of the film is slick  and there are some great bits of comedy is well  particularly toward the beginning . while it may have lost some of it  s social relevance  nearly sixty years after it  s release  it is still a gem .
