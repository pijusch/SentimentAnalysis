this movie maked me cry at the end  i watch at least    movies a week . i seen loads of great movies  even more crap  ones . but when ending scene  catharsic at it  s core  came i cried  and if you didn  t  you have serious problems  the story is archetypal  nothing new or original . but it  s real  because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist . glam isn  t my sort of music but i really admire all that they went through in early    s . . . at some point this directed me toward velvet goldmine  docudramas never really work very good . but this movie really meked us believe it all . . . because they don  t try to make it as a path full of glorious concerts  present musicians that are superheroes  groupie girls that are stupid and emotionally numb  they don  t glorify drugs and alcohol  they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes even   years late . . . once again great movie . since  leaving las vegas  i was never so moved by a movie .
