watch on the rhine is one of the best anti  nazi propaganda films made during world war two . paul lukas was certainly deserving of his oscar . bette davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was . i would recommend this film to those interested in that era  and  of course  the fabulous films of the late  great  ms . bette davis .
