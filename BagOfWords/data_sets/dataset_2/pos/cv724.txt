i don  t know why the critics trashed this movie . i hardly ever agree with them anyway .  br    br   the movie could have been a little scarier  i don  t usually go to horror movies  i even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime . i needn  t have bothered     the cinema was full of kids too  heh    . . . liam was great as always . i also liked catharine zeta jones  theo  and lili taylor  eleanor  nell   br    br   the house was very gothic and beautiful in a spooky way . the special and sound effects were awesome . i also loved the music score  particularly the gentle tunes for eleanor and her journey to save the children  how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power  peace and freedom .
