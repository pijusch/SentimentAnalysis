a few summer space campers actually were accidently sent into space by a robot . and the oxygen in ship was running short . they had to sent someone to a space station to get the gas tanks  etc  etc .  br    br   first of all  this movie  s plot is not possible in real life . but it gives a warm feelings of anything is possible if you set your heart in .  br    br   it is amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same after so many years .  i saw this movie for the first time in the year of      it was filmed in      there are quite a few people in that movie who are still working in hollywood .  br    br   the view was great from outer space . it does not look unreal . it is about  hours long  it runs so fast that you won  t even notice . you know that it is not real  but you just get sucked into it until the end .  br    br   overall  it is a good family movie .  br    br
