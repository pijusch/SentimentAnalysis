well   cube         vincenzo  s first movie  was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas that i  ve ever seen when talking about movies . they had just one scenery  a bunch of actors and a plot . so  what made it so special were all the effective direction  great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a labyrinth . his second movie   cypher         was all about its story  but it wasn  t so good as  cube  but here are the characters being tested like rats again .  br    br    nothing  is something very interesting and gets vincenzo coming back to his  cube days   locking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room . but instead of a thriller sci  fi  even some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that    nothing  is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world we  re living . once again vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing .  actors and a blinding white scenario  that  s all you got most part of time and you don  t need more than that . while  cube  is a claustrophobic experience and  cypher  confusing   nothing  is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate .  br    br   this movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget . of course that the movie fails sometimes  but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws . there  s nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that i had in movies since  cube  .
