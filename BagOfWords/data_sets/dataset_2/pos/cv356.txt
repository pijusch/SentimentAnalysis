possible spoilers  br    br   i recently watched this movie with my   year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences . ron ely is just right as doc . cool  calm  almost always in control  and with an occasional twinkle in his eye  . what more can one ask for  i have never read a doc savage book  so i don  t know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and derring  do . many people have compared this movie to raiders of the lost ark  which i don  t think is fair . the difference in budget is astounding  raiders must have at least   times the budget  . doc savage does not have the extensive location work that raiders has . special effects are also at a minimum but come on people  the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right . the sousa music is catchy  love that theme song  every time i watch the film  i end up humming the theme for days  . the best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy . highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the rooftops of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain seas . not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib  really   . overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day . i give it  out of   .  br    br   doc savage  doc savage . . . thank the lord he  s here
