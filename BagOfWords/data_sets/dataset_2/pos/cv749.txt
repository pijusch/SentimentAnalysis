i  ve long wanted to see this film  being a fan of both peter cushing and david mccallum . i agree that the romantic sub  plot was a waste of time  but the talent of mccallum shines through this juvie role . thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week . i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war  especially with the way things were throughout the     s . some of the boys are a bit scary . i certainly wouldn  t want to met them on a well  lit street  much less a dark one . there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well  or as they call him  a firefly .
