i was one of many that expected to see a glorified  yankee  doodle dandy portrayal of a day that  as famously quoted  should live in infamy  rather than glory . how wrong i was . these guys were there  right in the middle of it  and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking . and yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on september        .  br    br   two french filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a ny firefighter  particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks . at the beginning we see much of this footage  just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism . this was intended to be a film about regular people earning an honest living helping others  and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edge .  br    br   while investigating a suspect gas line  i think  my memory  s a little hazy on that   we suddenly hear a plane fly overhead . the camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers . what must the cameraman have been thinking at this time  recognising the importance of the footage the camera stays on  and possibly realizing the same thing  the fdny allow the camera to follow them into the building .  br    br   what follows is a true view from the front  lines . we see the commitment of the fdny  their reactions  the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling  as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside  while a second camera captures the events from the outside .  br    br   if it wasn  t for the horrific event they were covering  the footage alone would be any young doco  maker  s dream come true . quite simply  the footage deserves to be preserved for all time . but what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer . we see firefighters charging in without hesitation  people of different races helping one another escape to wave of rubble and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another  they are brothers  as they cannot reach one another in the confusion . there are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film  something hollywood could never duplicate  even though it  s trying  .  br    br       isn  t a film about politics . nor is it a film about religion  nationality or even jihad for that matter .     is a film about people  and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of .     is quite simply one of the most important films i  ve ever seen  and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me . you can  t duplicate this .
