despite a tight narrative  johnnie to  s election feels at times like it was once a longer picture  with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved . some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel  election   harmony is a virtue  but it  s still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions  though not the violence  in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call . it  s also a film where the most ruthless character isn  t always the most threatening one  as the chilling ending makes only too clear one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander .  br    br   simon yam  all too often a variable actor but always at his best under to  s direction  has possibly never been better in the lead  not least because tony leung  s much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful .
