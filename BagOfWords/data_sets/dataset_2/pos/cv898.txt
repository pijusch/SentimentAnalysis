russell  my fav  is gorgeous in this film . but more than that  the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow . everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected . the film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity . fabulous love story between lachlin and lil . i replay their scenes over and over again . anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people . all characters are cast and portrayed excellently .
