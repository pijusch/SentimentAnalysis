this movie isn  t as bad as i heard . it was enjoyable  funny and i love that is revolves around the holiday season . it totally has me in the mood to christmas shop and listen to holiday music . when this movie comes out on dvd it will take the place of christmas vacation in my collection . it will be a movie to watch every year after thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year . i heard that ben  s character was a bit crazy but i think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time . take it for what is it  a christmas comedy with a love twist . i enjoyed it . no  it isn  t titanic and it won  t make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two . so go laugh and have a good time
