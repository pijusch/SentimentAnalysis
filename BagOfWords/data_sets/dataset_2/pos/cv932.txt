another example of the unique talents of cary grant . a performance worthy of oscar consideration  yet once again shunned by the academy . mr . grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city . the pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis  loosely  for the more modern tom hanks vehicle   the money pit  .  br    br   if you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex  this movie is a must see .
