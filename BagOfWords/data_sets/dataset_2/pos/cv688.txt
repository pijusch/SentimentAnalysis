all the acting done in the first season has been really amazing . the first look you get of max and zach is through geneva locke and chris lazar or as i like to call them the minis . the minis do the best acting job that i have ever seen kids do . the main actors and actresses i . e . jessica alba michael weatherly etc . make you forget you are watching a fictional t . v . show they seem to make this show come alive . all in all this is the best show i have ever watched
