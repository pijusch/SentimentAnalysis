i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart  but i was flabbergasted when i saw the  .  rating to one of my childhood favourites . it doesn  t wow me as much at    but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie . kids will definitely love it and won  t mind the flaws  and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film . none of the film was preachy in any way  in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness . i will admit though that the story is on the thin side  and some scenes like screweyes  s death  which still freaks me out  may be a tad on the scary side . but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation . the music by james horner is very beautiful  and the song featured is memorable  catchy and amusing . i really liked the characters  louie is probably the most in  depth of them all  but the dinosaurs were at least engaging . martin short  s clown was both hilarious and emphatic  the part when he tells screweyes  i quit   had me in stitches . my favourite is screweyes though  an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent . if anything though  i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could  ve been more developed in terms of depth . the script  while not oscar  worthy  has its funny and heart  warming parts  and should keep kids and adults entertained . the voice acting for me was what made the movie . john goodman  martin short  rhea perlman  felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances  but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable . all in all  this is a good movie . i don  t get the rating  honestly i don  t . sure this film isn  t perfect  and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time  but it is good fun .  .     bethany cox
