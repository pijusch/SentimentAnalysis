for muslim women in western africa  married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard . the community may not explicitly endorse such behaviour  but equally  they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal  an attitude which of course enables it to continue . fortunately  the letter of the cameroonian law promises equality to all  and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the cameroonian legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children . what is notable  apart from the uplifting central story  is how  in spite of their informality  the courts are actually pragmatically progressive  if a case is actually bought . the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole cameroonian life  style  which  aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases  seems amazingly emotional and joyous compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of europe or north america . and while i concede that this comment may betray naivet on my part  this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidgin  english they speak . overall  this is a terrific little film  and much more fun to watch than you might imagine .
