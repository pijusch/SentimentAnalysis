spoilers     is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on the wtc .  french film makers who are in new york to film the actions of a nyfd are being confronted with this event and make the most of it . before     nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario . on the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change . as one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing plane  this is the only footage of the first impact . he rides with the firemen to the wtc and goes inside the building . as the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident . in the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possible  in the meanwhile we hear banging sounds  these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground  this is the most grueling moment in the documentary . then the tower collapses and our french friend has to run for his life  you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building . then a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black  he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown new york . because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybody  s memory . i saw the attacks live at home because i had the afternoon of  so this makes it even more realistic to watch .
