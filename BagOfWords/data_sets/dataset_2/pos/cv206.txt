okay  i know this does  nt project india in a good light . but the overall theme of the movie is not india  it  s shakti . the power of a warlord  and the power of a mother . the relationship between nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth . then things go terribly wrong . the interaction between nandini and her father in law  the power of their dysfunctional relationship  and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie . shah rukh khan  s performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor . it is easy to get caught up in the love  violence and redemption of lives in this film  and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax . the musical interludes are strengths  believable and well done .
