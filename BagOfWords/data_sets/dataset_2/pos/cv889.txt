this movie is far better than the original the jerk . i would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor . we have incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime discourse as we have from monty python .  br    br   the card game with the hobos and then with mr . suicide . the scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup . the original the jerk was too choreographed ans staged . while i like steve martin  he seemed like he was trying to hard . the jerk too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone . the jerk too is family friendly unlike the original the jerk .
