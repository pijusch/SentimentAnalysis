sure  this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clichs  but it  s entertaining  and that  s what i watch movies for . to be entertained . natasha henstridge is stunning  even with the short hair . her smile is radiant and her beauty can  t be disguised . as for michael vartan  i  m sure the women love him . the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film . i don  t understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them . i guess we see what we want to see .  br    br   olivia d  abo and michael rigoli were fun to watch  even if d  abo  s british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech . to tell you the truth i hadn  t really noticed it until i read these comments  but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me  but she was ideal for her role with that one exception .  br    br   it  s a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others  but who find their soul mates in one another . it may be an unlikely story  but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries  it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube . that  s why we watch them  to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen . i thought these actors did a good job of it  but hey  i  m a sentimental guy who tears up easily . don  t get me wrong though  it has to be a sentimental scene  and this movie had plenty of those .  br    br   i give it     only because i  m saving my      for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day . if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies  or whatever  make a note to watch it . i think you  ll like it .
