dick foran and peggy moran  who were so good together in the mummy  s hand  return for this very minor universal horror offering . but this time  instead of having wallace ford as the comedic sidekick  babe   we get fuzzy knight substituting as a silly buddy named  stuff  . but the results are nowhere near as charming  and the scare level is virtually nil .  br    br   dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle . peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride . but there is a tall and skinny john carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as  the phantom  who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself .  br    br   this  phantom  is not very mysterious  and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness . it  s always nice to see perky moran  but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of universal  s instantly forgettable misfires .
