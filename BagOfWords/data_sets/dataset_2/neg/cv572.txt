well this is a typical  straight to the toilet  slasher film .  br    br   long story short  a bunch of teenagers  young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons .  br    br   this movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage  br    br    naked women   teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky   gory death scenes   the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff  but never bra less   a creepy  crazy man who knows about the evil   lesbian kiss scene   sex being a killer   no plot  br    br   even then for a cheesy slasher film  it was really terrible . the atmosphere is totally dead . nothing  not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity  was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested . watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold .  br    br   give the demonic . . . . .     .
