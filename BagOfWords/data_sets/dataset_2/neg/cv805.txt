as much as i dislike saying  me too  in response to other comments  it  s completely true that the first   minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following   .  br    br   having been banned somewhere doesn  t make a film watchable . just because it doesn  t resemble a hollywood product does not make it credible .  br    br   worse yet  in addition to no discernible plot  other than there are lots of muddy places in russia and many people  even very old women  drink lots of vodka  a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating i  m in to my second package of rolaids .  br    br   as for spoilers  well  the film is so devoid of any narrative thread i couldn  t write one if i tried .  br    br   don  t waste your time or money  and don  t confuse this with good russian cinema .
