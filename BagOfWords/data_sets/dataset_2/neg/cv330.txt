lynne ramsey makes arresting images  and samantha morton can summon feeling with a gesture . so what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this mannered  pretentious lark .  br    br   ramsey can  t bring callar to life . her attempts are too arty and oblique . repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress as if morton  s obliterated gaze alone could supply character . we are in a blank warholian hell of self  indulgence for a film that has minutes to spare on bugs crawling across the floor  you might think it could get round to fleshing out its protagonist . but how will it do so if she rarely speaks  without the novel  s interior monologue  the celluloid morvern callar is nobody . small wonder ramsey has morton undress often .  br    br   that said  the first ten minutes were so impressively acted  shot and edited that my hopes were soaring . give the film that much it knows how to make promises  if not how to keep any .
