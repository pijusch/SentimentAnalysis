the minion is about . . . well  a minion . a servant of satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped . he is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another . anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage . dolph lundgren plays lukas  a member of a secret order of templars  who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion . the movie begins a thousand years ago  in the middle east where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion . then flash forward to      where the key winds up somewhere underground in new york . an archeologist is assigned to study  dig the place where the key was found . needless to say  the minion is after the key  and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and lukas and archeologist .  br    br   the movie  is just that  a low budget b  movie flick . the movie lacks energy  and just trods along . you  ll follow the chase but you won  t ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies  especially the terminator films  . the fight scenes with the minion is troublesome  in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is . it  skillfully  becomes a one  man army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to one  on one . and it  s supposed to be around for a long time . all this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience . the whole idea of a secret order of templars  a door to hell  and the key isn  t well explained . we are merely to accept that they just exist . the movie seems to have been made with the feeling there  s not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks . dolph lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else .  br    br   the verdict  of  stars .
