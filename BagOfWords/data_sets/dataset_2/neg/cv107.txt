i stopped by bb and picked up  zombie flicks to watch over the weekend . now  i understand that the effects will be cheesy  the acting will be sub  par  and the sets will be suspect . so i  m not expecting much . but it should at least have a story . stories don  t cost a thing except time . . . . . apparently  they didn  t have any time either .  br    br    zombie nation  had  zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers . the picture of the zombie on the front cover never appears in the movie . it was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre .  br    br   the running time is only   minutes but it felt like  hours . according to my wife  who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room   it sounded like zombie porn . . . . which if you think about  sounds kinda gross . . . . . but it wasn  t even that good .  br    br   the only suggestion i can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess .  br    br   it ended up being a free rental and i still feel ripped off . i rated it a  out of   because imdb won  t allow me to use decimals .
