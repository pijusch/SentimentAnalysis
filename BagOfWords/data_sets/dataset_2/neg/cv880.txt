i saw this film at the     toronto international film festival . based on a novella by science  fiction author brian aldiss  this film attempts to tell the story of tom and barry howe  conjoined twins who are plucked from their family by an impresario in order to form a rock band .  br    br   almost deliberately gimmicky  the film is also too clever by half  if you  ll pardon the pun  . by mixing genres  styles and moods  the directors  whose previous film was the excellent documentary lost in la mancha  lose their way pretty quickly . i was never sure whether i was meant to take it all seriously or not . flashbacks  dream sequences  it was all just a bit much . plus  the promised rock and roll just didn  t move me . i was reminded a bit too much at times of hedwig and the angry inch  a film i found original and moving . but in this case  the songs just weren  t as good  nor were the main characters sympathetic . a more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing velvet goldmine .
