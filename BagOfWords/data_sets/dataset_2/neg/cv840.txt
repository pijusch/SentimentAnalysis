i just saw this film on dvd last night  and decided to check out the reviews this morning . it seems that  i  robot  has polarized the critical viewing community here on imdb  and given rise to a lot of insults and name  calling  too  .  br    br   i find this somewhat surprising  as this film is not great  or even good   but neither is it terrible  or even really bad  . what this film really is  is . . . depressing . depressing that the us film  goer population is so ready to lap up insipid  clichd re  heats  and acclaim them as spectacular new works . this film as  retread  written all over it  from the plot line  an uneasy mix of asimov and modern  day uber  action  to smith  s character  a smart  mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium   to the special effects  that borrowed from matrix and a few others  .  br    br    i  robot  is  sadly  quite possibly the perfect action movie for today  s audience superficial plot  insipidly snappy dialog  and lots and lots of adrenaline . smith is mediocre  but we already knew that  he seems to be hollywood  s latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black bruce willis  . the story has lots of holes in it  of all sizes  but i don  t think most people drawn to this film are critically  minded enough to notice . perhaps a blockbuster by today  s standards  but very b  movie compared to true winners .
