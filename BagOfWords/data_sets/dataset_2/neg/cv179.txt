i really didn  t expect much from this film seeing as it has people from parkersburg wv  which is were i live  acting in it . this town is dull and so is this film . there were a few decent scened in the movie but i was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show . this movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasn  t any . unless you are from parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday  then stay away from this movie . the dialog will put you to sleep  the acting will bore you to tears and steven soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this . its a predictable movie with no surprises . what you see is what you get and that is a   minute tour of parkersburg west virginia and belpre ohio without a narrator .
