i had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now an unexpected love . it  s not really worth looking for but i was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on lifetime . everything  s pretty restrained and you don  t really get an idea of who these characters are so  as a viewer  i wasn  t able to become emotionally invested in the storyline . i guess i  m not the target audience for this but i  m not sure who is . everything  s muted and soft focus and earth tones . . . nothing  s very interesting . i had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but it  s handled so discreetly that i was disappointed . rent personal best instead .
