my wife is a fanatic as regards this show . that being the case i bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order . i personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad . alyssa milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as poison ivy  embrace of the vampire to name a few  the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals . i  ve seen better special effects in the old republic pictures serials i saw as a child . i can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though i don  t know if it was their own choosing or not . please . please don  t renew for another season as enough is enough  bob
