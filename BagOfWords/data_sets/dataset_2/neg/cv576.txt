i  ve seen a lot of movies and rarely would i ever rate a movie    but this movie was beyond terrible .  br    br   the acting was terrible  the plot was ridiculous  the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying . usually when i watch scary movies i think it  s dumb when the characters hears a noise in house  forest  school  etc and then yells out  hello is anyone there    but at least they  re believable when they do it . . this movie couldn  t even get that right .  br    br   this is a movie that  ll make other b  horror movies like venom and the fog look like academy award winning masterpieces .  br    br   i always have an open mind while watching movies and i can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and i write this comment so that anyone else who  s thinking of watching this movie will think again . it  s awful
