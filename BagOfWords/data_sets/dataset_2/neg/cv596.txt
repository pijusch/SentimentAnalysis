well  what can you say about a barbara cartland adaptation   br    br   there are some amazing actors in this  oliver reed  sarah miles  christopher plummer  but they clearly are clocking up the money .  br    br   lysette anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other cartland epics  anthony with hugh grant  who looks suitably embarrassed  and gilbert with helena bonham carter .  br    br   if you really want to see a  watchable  adaptation of cartland  the bonham carter one is the one to go for   a hazard of hearts   what a title    . gilbert is the weak link in that  but bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act  and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek  edward fox  diana rigg
