the action in this movie beats sunny bhai in gadar . akshay kumar possess the superpowers of leonidus in     neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman . it is hilarious . except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i cannot see anything positive in this film . the story looks like the writer told his   yr old son to write . the movie is so unreal that anil kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director . except for the directors tashan to make this movie there is no other tashan . i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody .     is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero .
