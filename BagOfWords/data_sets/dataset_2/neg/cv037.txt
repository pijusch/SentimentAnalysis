i was very displeased with this move . everything was terrible from the start . the comedy was unhumorous  the action overdone  the songs unmelodious . even the storyline was weightless . from a writer who has written successful scripts like guru and dhoom  i had high expectations . the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all . of course  kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds . i think hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done . they tend to exaggerate way too much . in chinese films  this style works because that is their signature piece . but  hindi cinema  s signature are the songs . a good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic . but  in the future  i  m sure these action movies will get much sharper . also to be noted comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly . good luck next time .
