  it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable .  and for good reason they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman . and let  s not kid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of allen  s bergman pretensions  allen  s whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding . what i don  t get is this why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman  but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for  ripping off  hitchcock in his suspense  horror films  in robin wood  s view  it  s a strange form of cultural snobbery . i would have to agree with that .
