have you ever heard the saying that people  telegraph their intentions   well in this movie  the characters  actions do more than telegraph future plans   they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head . this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better  or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced . embeth davidtz  s character is not mysterious  just wooden  and kenneth branagh doesn  t succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have .  br    br   the bottom line obvious plot  one  note performances  unlikeable characters  and grotesque  southern  accents employed by british actors .
