i was given the book version of kazaam for my  th birthday  and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie  but this time they were wrong . at least with the movie it  s over soon .  br    br   the acting in this is terrible  which i expected from a film with shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster  which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there  . the kid in the film that plays max is whiny and a terrible actor . he  s bullied by neighborhood kids  which i don  t blame them because he  s a little douche bag .  br    br   the story is just plain stupid and extremely clich . about a boy who  s father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father .  br    br   even at  years old i thought this was a stupid idea . it  s a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it  s an embarrassment and should have never been made . i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks  but you should already know just by reading the plot .
