raising victor vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be being real . unfortunately  there is no reality to this film . the characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake .  br    br   the reason  bad directing . peter sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal . it seems mr . sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel . wrong  it just gives it a badly  made feel . similarly  shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film  it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what  s on screen instead of enhance it .  br    br   of course  what  s on screen is so painfully fake  as if mr . sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look  hip  to his sundance buddies and show how  edgy  a filmmaker he is .  br    br   overall  the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director mr . sollett is . next time  how about taking a few writing and directing classes
