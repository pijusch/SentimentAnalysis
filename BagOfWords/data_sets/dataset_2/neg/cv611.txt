after being a big fan of the ten minute t . v episodes of  stella street   i awaited this film with excitement and anticipation . unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed .  br    br   i was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t . v episodes  and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing  as if the actors had said them once  and couldn  t be bothered to say them again . i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again .  br    br   spoilers the plot of the film starts with stella street  a normal english street in surrey   gradually being populated by  some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years   including michael caine  al pacino  jack nicholson and the rolling stones . all the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster  and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people . there are some nice moments  but on the whole  the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring . end of spoilers  br    br   in the t . v episodes  all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil cornwell  including females   but in the film ronni ancona is added to the cast . i think this was a mistake . her impersonations weren  t funny  and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do .  br    br   if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street  you may find this film entertaining . but if you were a fan  i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated .
