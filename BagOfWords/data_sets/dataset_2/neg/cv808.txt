the worst movie i have seen in quite a while . interesting first half with some engaging  terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late  night bar . the movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock  read disgust  without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else .  br    br   i wanted to walk out  but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect . still  time is precious  as the director himself observed in his intro  and i really begrudge the time i wasted on the second half of this one .  br    br   saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie  especially the female lead .
