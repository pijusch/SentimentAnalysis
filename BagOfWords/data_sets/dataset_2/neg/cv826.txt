in the first one it was mainly giant rats  but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too . this one  however  is just giant rats period  well giant rats and one really growing little boy . this one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats . . . you know how it is . this movie has some kills and its moments  but i find it to be on par with the original  i just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies . well  that is not true . . . i actually like  empire of the ants   maybe i just do not care for giant rodents . all in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre . i just can  t recommend this one .
