that is the only question i am left with . why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast  why was the writing so bad  it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters  why did it not make any sense at all  why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and  hollywood  the hell out of it when all it needed was good  smart story telling  why  i never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they  re released . i hope for the sake of freeman an spacey  who are oscar winners  that this never is released to the big screens in america .  br    br   as someone that holds a bachelors degree in journalism  the whole story is just utterly laughable . i just . . . think the script had potential  but the execution turned it into a clich  and an awful one at that . just . no .
