i read the novel  jane eyre  for the first time back in     . it was round that time that i saw the bbc  version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke . it was an excellent version and very much like the book . years later  i laid eyes on this version and was horrified . william hurt is totally miscast as mr rochester . mr rochester is a passionate character  where as william hurt portrays him as a block of ice . the same goes for charlotte gainsborough . it was like watching two zombies together . this is story about love and passion  but i couldn  t see it in this version . no  back to the bbc  version . a wonderful time is guaranteed .
