this movie had me going . the title was perhaps the greatest idea that i heard . i thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the us and a group of lone survivors  band together  and plan to take out the zombies . dead wrong  it  s about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets what  s coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge . as you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved . where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation .  br    br   first off  the zombie women look like victoria secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face . what are zombies but mindless  debatable intelligent  cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs  these zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models  they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies . sure the eating and killing is there  but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement  although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre  it makes fun of that genre and asks the question   why can  t zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines   i would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies . i would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much  it  s an insult and as for scarynot even .
