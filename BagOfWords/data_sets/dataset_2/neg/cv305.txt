the premise is amazing and the some of the acting  notably sally kellerman and anthony rapp  is charming . . . but this film is near unwatchable . the music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap . most of the singing is off  key . i think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it . . . the dialogue is really stupid and trite . the movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub  plots . i found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after   wondering  when is it ever going to end .
