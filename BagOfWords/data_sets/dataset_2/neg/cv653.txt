universal soldier the return is not the worst movie ever made . no  that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner . however  perhaps no movie i have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did universal soldier the return .  br    br   this film is a sci  fi  action travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it . the acting is as bad as any movie i  ve ever seen . the plot is terrible and predictable . the special effects are pathetic . in short  anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves . us the return makes previous van damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces . some movies are so bad  they  re good . believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them . i  m really not sure what else to say here . i doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadn  t already  but just in case don  t .
