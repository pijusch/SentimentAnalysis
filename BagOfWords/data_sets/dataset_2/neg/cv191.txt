when i spotted that noah wyle and ricky schroder were in the same movie  i was like  score  i admit  i was eager to see the movie . and i have to say  the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in a way . then it went all down hill . i didn  t expect it to be a dump of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo . they took every possible controversial topic and threw it into one stupid story . i was appalled that noah was involved in anything of the sort  especially his role . nobody with a fully functional brain would actually accept all that crap about the vietnam war . if anyone really wants to know how communism was like  sit down and read a book on it . and not one that praises it or is against it  just the cold hard facts .  br    br   i only watched a few scenes here and there only because i wanted to see ricky  s body  but that was all that interested me . everything else about this movie irritated me .
