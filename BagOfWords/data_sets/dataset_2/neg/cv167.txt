humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film  and be forced to play a part  mexican or he would have been suspended . believe me  he made the wrong choice  presumably  after the success of  dodge city   warners tried a follow  up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies  like alan hale  guinn  big boy  williams  frank mc hugh and the ever  present john litel  but they made the huge mistake of trying to present miriam hopkins as a love interest for flynn v . randolph scott  and as a singer to really make things bad  because she proved one thing  and that is she cannot sing . the story was not too bad  but with bogie clearly miscast also  it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong  and on a low budget  but in fairness  color would not have helped .
