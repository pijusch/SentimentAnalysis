and i mean ultra light . this film features four giant stars  about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that .  br    br   there really isn  t too much to say about this stinker  other than that although it has a couple of really good bits  most of it isn  t very funny . nor does it work at all as a romance . how about as a romantic comedy  not on your life . most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated  much less amusing .  br    br   what  s really ashame is the premise is not bad at all . this movie could have been so much more  especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted  complete with phony quotes from critics . the film uncovers the un  mined territory of the press junket   those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews . but instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes  it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film  s lame romance .  br    br   the same with catherine zeta  jones  character   the whinny  self centered movie star . zeta  jones does a good job with what she  s given  but she  s given practically nothing . it  s all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we  ve heard about stars over the years .  br    br   in the end  it is hard to understand what made zeta  jones  julia roberts  john cusack and billy crystal sign aboard this doomed ship  which sinks like a rerun of  the love boat .  in fact  as the old joke goes  they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal . it would probably make a better story . so  go ahead and tell us  filmmakers  what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this
