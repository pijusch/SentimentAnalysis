the film is poorly casted  except for some familiar old hollywood names . other performances by unknown names  i . e .  jennifer gabrielle  are uninspiring . i have seen other films by this director  unfortunately this is one of his worst . perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay   br    br   in a positive note  kim bassinger  s and pat morita  s performance saved the movie from oblivion . i enjoyed pat more in karate kid  though . there are many good movies to see  and in short  this one is not one of them . save your money and the celluloid .  br    br   jason vanness
