i didn  t know what to expect from the film . well  now i know . this was a truly awful film . the screenplay  directing and acting were equally bad . the story was silly and stupid . the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film  but he didn  t . i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad . where was the focus to the film  where was anything in this film  christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it . it was shabbily done and a waste of my money . do not see this film .
