the plot of  edison  was decent  but one actor in particular ruined the entire film . justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie . he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen  and should face the same fate as the entire f . r . a . t . squad .  br    br   whether it was an emotional scene  an action scene  or even a silent scene  justin timberlake managed to ruin it .  br    br   do not waste your time watching this film . don  t even bother downloading it  midget porn would be a much better choice .  br    br   and justin  if you  re reading this  stick to music . even though you  re no good at that  you  ve done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing .
