angels who got a little icky were banned from heaven and now reside in a british forest where they seduce and chop up teens . talk about high concept . on the plus side this little mother gives us tom savini  but since his acting range is limited to two minutes screen  time  his five minute presence seems a tad long . the angels run around the forest naked for the most part of the movie  but though they might have the body of an angel  their faces sure look like joan rivers on a bad day . mediocre acting and amateurish gore  effects don  t help and the night scenes fatally recall paris hilton  s most famous movie . so bad that it is really bad .
