nothing to say but wow  has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field  well this happens about   times in this movie  clearly the directors  favorite scare tactic  . in one of the opening scenes the smooth talking  hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film . shortly after he arrives to the field the  contestants show up and  although it is clearly at latest  in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute . after about   minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown  s history in which we see some of his previous victims . if you watch this movie check out the ladies chest . . her ribs go all the way to her neck  it was flat out disgusting . most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day . the few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the blair witch project or random shots from the directors backyard . the movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically .  br    br   definitely rent this movie if you have ever been snuck up on in an open field .  br    br   signed  the answer
