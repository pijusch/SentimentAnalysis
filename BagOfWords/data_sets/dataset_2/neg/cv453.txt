if fassbinder has made a worse film  i sure don  t want to see it  anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this  to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like  the bitter tears of petra von kant  . this film bogs down with so much arty  quasi  symbolic images it looks like a parody of an  art  film  . the scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where elvira  s prostitute friend channel  surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer  s endurance . but what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just elvira and her ex  wife and  or her daughter . these are the only moments that display any real human emotion  and prove that at the core of this horrible film  there was an excellent film struggling to free itself . what a waste .
