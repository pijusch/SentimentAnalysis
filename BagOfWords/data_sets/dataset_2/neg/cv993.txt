i have seen a lot of bad films . most of the time i can enjoy a crappy horror film for what it is . but this really takes badness to new extremes .  br    br   it is bland  the plot for what it is never really goes anywhere and takes its time over it . there are no shocks  no horror  no suspense  just a load of guys rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick finish .  br    br   a blight on the crappy horror genre  avoid at all costs .  br    br
