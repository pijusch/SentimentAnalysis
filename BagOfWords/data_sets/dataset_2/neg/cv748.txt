this ranks as one of the worst movies i  ve seen in years . besides cuba and angie  the acting is actually embarrassing . wasn  t archer once a decent actress  what happened to her  the action is decent but completely implausible . the make up is so bad it  s worth mentioning . i mean  who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film . someone should tell the make up artist  and the dop that you  re not supposed to actually see it . the ending is a massive disappointment  along the lines of  and then they realized it was all a dream   br    br   don  t waste your time or your money . you  re better off just staring into space for  hours .
