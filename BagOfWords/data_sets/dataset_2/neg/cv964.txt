a friend of mine lent this video to me and i was fairly excited to watch it  but after ten minutes of james hetfield  s slow pitched vocals and lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion i began to think  why am i watching this   that question will be coursing through your minds in     minutes after you hit play . i gave the tape back the same day  as you would suspect  not worth buying or watching   br    br   just my opinion   br    br
