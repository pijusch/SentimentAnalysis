this movie is not based on the bible . it completely leaves christ out of the movie . they do not show the rapture or the second coming of christ . let alone talk about it . it does not quote from scriptures . the end times are called the great tribulation . the movie does not even show bad times . the seven bowls  seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a   second news cast of the sea changing it  s structure . the anti  christ was killed     years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended . the only part they got correct was there was two prophets . the did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures . the worst part of it was i really wanted it to be a good movie . i wanted to take unsaved people to it . i feel that the movie is evil . it is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does . i just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books .  br    br   the second problem with the movie is it was just bad . bad acting  bad special effects  bad plot and poor character development . i have seen better episodes of miami vice .
