its spelled s  l  a  s  h  e  r  s . i was happy when the main character flashed her boobs . that was pretty tight . before and after that the movie pretty much blows . the acting is like e  list and it  s shown well in the movie . not to mention it is so low budget that preacherman and chainsaw charlie are played by the same person . the whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film . the only other reason i liked the movie was because chainsaw charlie and doctor ripper were funny . they said many stupid things that made me laugh . other than that if you see this movie at blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind lawnmowerman  . anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated .
