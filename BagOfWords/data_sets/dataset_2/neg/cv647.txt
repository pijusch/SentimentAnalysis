i  m sorry to say this  but the acting in this film is horrible . the dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever . perhaps i got the  dress rehearsal  version by mistake . the director over  uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves . the story is pretty well written  and the fight sequences are actually better than i have seen in many action films . the fights seem pretty real . but all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point  blank automatic weapon fire  grenades  morter rounds  and bazookas . the enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots i have ever seen  especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about   yards  and every bazooka shot is wide by at least   feet . those bazookas need serious site calibration .
