wow . i have seen some really bad movies in my time  but this one truly takes the cake . it  s the worst movie i  ve seen in the past decade  no exaggeration .  br    br   as a us army veteran of the war in afghanistan  i found it nearly impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film  not because it brought back memories  far from it  but because there was absolutely no attempt at  authenticity  to be found anywhere in the film . not so much as the tiniest little shred . it seemed like it had been written by an  year  old child who got all his notions of war  and soldierly behavior  straight out of comic books . the film was made in honduras  which should have been a clue  but even that can  t fully explain the atrocious production values of this clich  ridden piece of trash .  br    br   i could try to list all the endless technical flaws  but it would take virtually forever . from the ancient unit shoulder patches which have not been seen or worn since wwii  and the character  s name tags  like  colcollins   worn by the character  colonel collins    which was actually spelled using the reversed  mirror  image  n  of the russian alphabet  not the us alphabet  the list just goes on and on . the uniforms  the equipment  the plot  and most especially the behavior of the characters themselves   every single scene was just chock  full of ridiculous flaws  inaccuracies and utterly mindless clichs .  br    br   neither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or believable . it was all laughably childish  in the extreme . this was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal strictly to pre  pubescent boys  and i have little doubt that even they would find this film utterly absurd .  br    br   in short  this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all . it  s a total waste of time . i  d strongly advise anybody reading this to pass this garbage by it  s truly not worth wasting a single moment of your time for .
