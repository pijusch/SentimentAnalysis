the only reason i didn  t score this a one is that sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film . it is a technically adept film .  br    br   that having been said  this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven . most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program  rather than actual fact . and sibrel  s  irrefutable proof  that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics .  br    br   i do not recommend watching this  but if you do  see it at google video for free . don  t let bart sibrel profit from your curiosity .
