i can  t really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on asimov than the art direction . forget the product placement disaster  the unconvincing performance from will smith and the gargantuan plot  holes . this wasn  t only laughable and but painful to watch . even the action was boring . a mixture of mtv inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children .  br    br   what a shame that sci  fi this bad can still be made after we  ve had bladerunner  minority report or to a lesser extent dark city  by the same director  . this one really belongs in the bottom    list . truly awful .
