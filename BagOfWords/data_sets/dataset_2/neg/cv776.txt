i saw this movie at the afi dallas festival . most of the audience  including my wife  enjoyed this comedy  drama  but i didn  t . it stars lucas haas  brick  alpha dog   molly parker  kissed  the five senses  hollywoodland  and adam scott  first snow  art school confidential  . the director is matt bissonnette  who  s married to molly parker . all three actors do a fine job in this movie about  friends  the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third . it all takes place at a lake house and it looks wonderful . the film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama  and i thought it needed to be the other way around .
