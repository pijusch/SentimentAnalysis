i notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings             or not old enough to appreciate them . i think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it .  br    br   i was a youngster at the time of apollo  but i was old enough to understand what was going on . the entire world followed the moon landings . our families gathered around the tv to watch the launch . newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings  on each day  from launch to landing  from moonwalks to moon liftoff  all the way to splashdown  in a multitude of languages . in school  some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on tv . during apollo   the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate . you couldn  t go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was . the world was truly one community .  br    br   now with a buffer of    odd years after the fact  it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down . we are left with our history books  and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to  prove  it with a bunch of lies and made  up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing otherwise   not to mention the proof that dwells in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic days .
