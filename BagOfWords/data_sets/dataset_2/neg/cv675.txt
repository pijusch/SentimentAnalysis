i don  t think any movie of van damme  s will ever beat universal soldier but u never know . this movie was good but not as good as  st . vd returns a luc  must do battle again . he tries  b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle . vd has a kid this time from ally w .  good it showed a pic of them  . goldberg was cool  he does his famous move  forgot what its called cause i don  t watch wrestling  sucks . vd  goldberg had some good fights . it was the ending like the  st but just not that good . vd does his best move in his career  like always  the helicopter kick . even though  the final ending should  ve been longer . anyway  it is worth seeing but it will never top the original .
