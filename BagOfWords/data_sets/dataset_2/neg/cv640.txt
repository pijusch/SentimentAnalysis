some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series have made some really great films but they sure as heck are not showing much skill with this series . particularly the writing . ok  the first season was somewhat better but these new episodes they are creating just stink . i  m a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage . nothing new or genuinely interesting . few of them are visually creative . it  s just typical fabricated hollywood crap  uninteresting  childish  poorly conceived and in some cases  flat out laughable . much like tales from the crypt the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity  other then that this series blows hard . i get the impression sometimes that they hired a bunch of eighth  graders to write the episodes . maybe they did .
