dire . just dire . the script is contrived  the acting painful  and the story just drags along . it is  without a doubt  a celebration of sally potter and little else . this wouldn  t be so bad  but she  s the director  writer and star of the film  and so is just self  glorification . i found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters  and the ending came not a moment too soon . it has two redeeming features . first is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely  particularly in paris  and look rather good in black and white . secondly  whether you  re a fan of tango or not  the music is by and large  excellent  except where sally starts singing  . watch this film at your own risk  or if you need an unintentional laugh . i am sure it appeals to someone . statistically  it has to .
