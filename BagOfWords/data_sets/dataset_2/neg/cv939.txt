not since caligula have i considered turning off the movie half  way through . . . . but then with this one  i was only   minutes in when i considered . unfortunately  i did make it all the way through . make sure that you do not .  br    br   it  s not that cradle of fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual . it  s that it  s not any of those things  yet it so desperately wants to be all of them . instead  it  s boring  trite  ordinary  predictable  and unexceptionally poorly executed  shot on video  high school special effects  no sense of even basic visual storytelling  dialog barely audible . . . not that it  s worth hearing  though  .  br    br   this movie is proof for the argument that even the straight  to  video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere .
