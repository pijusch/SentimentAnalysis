i couldn  t watch more than   minutes of it . it  s a great combination of really bad acting and really bad directing . the shots used are disgusting  they broke the    degrees angle all the time . my head hurts try to watch that load of  you know what  . dirt on the  mystery machine  window make you see light from the lighting on the windows . . . annoying . what else . . . it  s so badly framed all the time it  s just make you want to scream at that lady directing there . i only directed short films  but i  m pretty sure i  d be way better than that directing a feature film . . . . the story is unbelievable  just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that it  s gonna be pretty awful . so pretty much  try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost  it  ll save you the  bucks or so for the rental  and that  h   hour of your life you  ll never get back . . .
