for the first forty minutes  empire really shapes itself up it appears to be a strong  confident  and relatively unknown gangster flick . at the time i didn  t know why  i thought it was good  but now i do .  br    br   one of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful . i don  t mind films with psychos and things  to prove a point  take jackie brown  for example  but they  re all so terribly shallow in this  but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment . you literally feel a knot pull in your stomach . another major problem is the protagonist . he is smug  arrogant  yet  ironically enough  not that bad . he doesn  t seem tight enough to be a drug  dealing woman killer . the fact is  at the end of the day  this film is completely pretentious . not slick  not clever  just dull  and meaningless  this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs .  br    br    out of    out of
