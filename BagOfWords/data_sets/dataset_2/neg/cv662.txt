this movie was absolutly awful . i can  t think of one thing good about it . the plot holes were so huge you could drive a hummer through them . the acting was soo stuningly bad that even jean claude should be ashamed  and that is saying alot    and dialogue  what dialogue    to think that i was a fan of the first one  i use that comment loosely  its more like a guilty pleasure  than anything else  . this movie had goldberg in it for crying out loud     nothing good can come of this movie . what makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you can  t even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of    this has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time .     because it is soo hard for me to give a  .
