i  m sorry for jean  after having such a good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his worst movie in is career . this movie was shot down terribly by horrible acting jobs by goldbeg  romeo  and whatever that computers name was . also  some scenes may have been just a little unnesicary . truly  bad movie .
