darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman  with odd ties to elvis presley  running into a sea of elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in nevada . . . and accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own . kim basinger  a still  attractive actress of considerable merit  likes to pick quirky movies to play in  but this dreadful screenplay  by mitchell ganem and adam  michael garber  hasn  t an iota of good humor . the stereotypes and low  ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy  but even on a shambling  shameful level  the picture is crude and sloppy . if you do watch  see if you can count how much extraneous shots there are of basinger behind the wheel of her pink cadillac  hands always in the same position and a non  plussed look on her face . hopefully both she and elvis were well paid . no stars from
