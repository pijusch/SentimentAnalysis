first of all  what is good in the movie  some pretty actress  the exotic background  the fact that the actors don  t laugh while acting  i would have if i had been in their situation   i don  t know . the storyline is simple  a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who  another abstract painter  killed his little brother  a male prostitute  raped by another priest when he was young . . .  . i  m afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers  art or religion . dennis hopper is not very good here . this is the worst episode of the worst season of  profiler   the serie  with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences  the uncle is the policeman who  the girl who lives at another victim  s house could have a baby with the priest  etc .  etc  .
