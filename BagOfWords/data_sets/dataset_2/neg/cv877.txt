first of all  i am not a huge fan of contemporary turkish cinema  which is because  the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline . this movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos  as the director and marketing ads imply . in my mere opinion  the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale  in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country  cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what i meant .  br    br   however  the acting is near perfect . in fact  most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what altioklar lacked talent  all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job  even the less experienced ones .  like janset  at least  altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation  just because he knows well how to choose the cast . other than that  he is just a media monkey  who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent . come on  art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked  half naked women . and just because media boasts off  no director becomes a milestone in the history of turkish cinema . just close your ears and o something real artistic  i am waiting eagerly to applause your next work . hope  this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach .  br    br   in short pros  good acting  hot women  just kidding     cons  each and every single thing  other than the cast
