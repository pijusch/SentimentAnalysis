i  ve now written reviews for several of the moh episodes  and this is among the worst . an interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll . if watching people things they never would in real life amuses you   let  s check out the basement     then this is your show . except  it  s not amusing or entertaining  it  s just annoying .  br    br   the extent of the virus is never  ever showed . i can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only  as the resulting situation is very  very frightening . but then things deteriorate as daughter lets obviously deranged dad into the home  and ultimately dies at his hands . the woman flees north  and runs into a few tens situations . then  some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her  things that make you go huh   . or something . then  she is huddling for warmth . the end .  br    br   awful . these directors are mailing this tripe in .
