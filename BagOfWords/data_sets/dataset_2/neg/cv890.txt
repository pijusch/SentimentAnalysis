now  i  m one to watch movies that got poor reviews  and say   hmm . . . this isn  t so bad   i loved the cable guy  and thought that my big fat independent movie was great . keep in mind  i really didn  t start watching this with high hopes  but i figured that maybe . . . just maybe . . . it would be bad in a kind of way i could laugh at it . i was wrong . at no point at all during my suffering through this  film   and i use that term sparingly  was i even close to being mildly entertained . to start  shaq makes quentin tarantino look like marlon brando when it comes to acting . i hate rap music  but as far as i could tell  an amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him . the main character is simply annoying  and not a character that it  s easy to like . quite frankly  i would rather eat a greasy turd out of a harlequin fetus  bloody sores than watch this again .
