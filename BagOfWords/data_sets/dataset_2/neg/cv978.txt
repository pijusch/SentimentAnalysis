my friend  s mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out  so when she brought home the convent  a horror movie  i couldn  t wait to watch it . given that it  s supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious  i can say that in some weird way  i like this movie .  br    br   yes  the acting is bad  and yes  it  s the cheapest movie i  ve ever seen  but it  s so damn funny   what  are you smoking ca  rack    i didn  t know this movie even was ever released . . . i figured it was too bad . . .  br    br   yeah  so . . . overall the movie is pretty bad  you gotta admit that much at least  but i promise you  you will get a good laugh out of it .  br    br   this movie kinda sucks but it  s good for a laugh . . . especially that guy that holds the  dagger of despair  . . the dagger of despaaaaaair
