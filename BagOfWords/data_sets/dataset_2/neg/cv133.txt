ll cool j . morgan freeman . dylan mcdermott . kevin spacey . john heard . cary elwes . roslyn sanchez . justin timberlake   wait a minute . justin timberlake  and he  s the star  i should have known better than to rent edison force . in fact  i did know better . but in a moment of absolute weakness  i rented this stv . when you have big names like freeman and spacey in an stv  you know it  s one of two things an indie or a dog . as in sat  on  a  shelf . which this did . and with good reason . the plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la magnum force  and  journalist  timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them . he is targeted for his efforts   or maybe i should say for his horrible acting . i turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing . just awful . the real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard  looking like nothing so much as a hobo . you just know the director was not in control . freeman is clearly slumming .
