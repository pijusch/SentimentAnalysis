might contain possible spoilers  not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter   br    br   why does disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion  sure it  s cheaper for them  but after a while  wouldn  t you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off . house of villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all . some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are the voices don  t even remotely match up and iago is evil again  since when    i know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy disney films . even the movie  s musical number  which had been disney  s specialty for years  stunk . i wouldn  t recommend this film to anyone even the very young . all i can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released  it  s only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses disney in overall quality .
