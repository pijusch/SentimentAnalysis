i was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever . i didn  t realize it was disney until it was too late . i was appalled by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story . it was as if someone made a movie out of a  th grader  s book report on the novel . meg did well in school and neither her nor her father wore glasses . mrs murray  meg  s mother  was not portrayed as much of a scientist at all they left out her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet . and that  s just the beginning . by halfway through the movie i found myself shouting at the screen  much to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who hadn  t read the book . i wish i had more thumbs so i could give four thumbs down for this one . the only good thing i can say is that for a person who has not read the book  this movie is kinda alright .
