this movie has a few things going for it right off the bat . having dani filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie . admittedly  i love cradle of filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before i watched it . dani filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead . the independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor . there are some gorgeous actresses in this movie . for being low budget  the special effects weren  t bad either . the ways that people died were very creative and nightmarish .  br    br   now on to the cons . there is very little talking throughout this whole movie  thus making for very little as far as character development . it  s hard to fear for the lives of limp  static characters . when there was a little talking  the f bomb was abundant  popping up in random places . yes  i understand people swear but it seems like a preteen boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language . the storyline  what i could make out of it  was pretty good although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering what  s happening .  br    br   in the end  cradle of fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence  but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline  it just doesn  t work too well . rent it though  if you  re a morbid person looking to sate your blood and flesh appetite .
