the film is severely awful and is demeaning to rape victims . on the surface  it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface  what lies is a not  so  positive message about rape . aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a woman . she needs a man to help her . when the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her  she does not stand up for herself . it is all left to anil kapoor to do all the talking while aishwarya does all the crying .  br    br   the director  satish kaushik  went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive . what would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way . the director is famous for being chauvinistic . his films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles . he needs to learn that just because the role is controversial  it does not mean that the character herself is strong .  br    br   the most degrading scene in the film is when aishwarya  cleans  herself after just being raped . she does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty . though it is commendable that shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light  what he does not show us is whether ash  s father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing . thus we are left with a confusing message about rape .  br    br   the comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this . even more so  the comedy is simply not funny . ash is wooden in her role while anil kapoor does nothing but shout . the music is mediocre except for the title track  which is beautifully picturised  the only bright point of this film  . sonali bendre  s role is disappointing and pointless . overall  what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful mish  mash that will give some viewers severe indigestion .
