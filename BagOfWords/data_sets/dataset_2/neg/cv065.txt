i was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in north carolina . instead i watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the duke family . and this went on and on . if mr . mcelwee  s family had prevailed over the dukes i doubt that mr . mcelwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco  related diseases . i grew up near the area where mr . mcelwee  s family began it tobacco business  i expected more than mcewee  s continual focus on his family . i learned very little about the history of tobacco in the nc economy and the ramifications to the state  s economy by tighter regulation of tobacco . the countless references to the movie  bright leaves  are out of place  so what if gary cooper played mr . mcelwee  s great grandfather  does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the north carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film  i didn  t .
