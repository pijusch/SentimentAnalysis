jane eyre  is one of the greatest novels in the english language and this screenwriter should of read it . i hate it when writers use spark notes for what a novel is all about . this movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book .  br    br   the whole  red room  is so down played that i wonder why they even bother to put it in . in the book the  red room  is foreshadowing for the whole story and the rest of jane  s life . helen burns is treated so badly in the movie i  m sure she was happy to die and leave early . in the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head . the whole christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie .  br    br   do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as charlotte bronte masterfully told it .
