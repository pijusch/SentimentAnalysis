the first half was ok  but the last half really  really disappointed . it  s funny the producers even admitted they didn  t have a clue for the ending  and it really showed . whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this . i really didn  t want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn  t really worth that effort . when battlestar galatica first came out i was really excited with the prospect of a better remake  it didn  t happen that first season border on being space porn . they eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama  so i started watching again . but to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel  same with baltar and six was pretty dumb .
