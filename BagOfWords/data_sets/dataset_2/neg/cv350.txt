i can  t believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny . shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty  disgust and stupidity   there  s something about mary  leaves little reason to stay until the end . sure  cameron diaz is very pretty  but that is never going to be enough to save a movie . ben stiller tries hard to work within the plot  and is obviously very talented  but the movie is a loser .  br    br   not once were any of the scenes believable . the shots were badly timed and poorly framed . the farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs . i check imdb to see what they are working on just so i know what to avoid .  br    br        the bonus is from the one time i smiled . it  s not like i  m immune to humor or alone in my opinion . my wife hated it  too . the next day we saw  rush hour  and laughed ourselves silly . this movie just stunk .
