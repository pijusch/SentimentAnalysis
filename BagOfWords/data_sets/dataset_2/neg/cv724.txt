you know jason  you know freddy  and you know leatherface . now  get ready for the safety pin killer  that  s right  in killer workout  a dumb slasher movie if i  ve ever seen one  the unseen murderer dispatches his  or her   victims with an oversized  novelty safety pin . it is an odd choice to be sure  the kind of thing that deserves an explanation . naturally  the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing .  br    br   as the title suggests  an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect . in fact  the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer  just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed . and since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead  it  s really just process of elimination .  br    br   oddly  while the entire name cast is killed off  the aerobics classes continue in earnest . in fact  nothing is capable of stopping the dancing . while three men are murdered in the next room  the workout goes on . death isn  t even a factor one character dies  but is still seen prominently in the later workout sessions . director david prior knew what he was doing when named the movie killer workout and not logical workout .  br    br   cop chases  explosive tanning beds  and hundreds of shots of women  s exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure . much like the woman caught in the tanning bed  i felt very uncomfortable by the end of killer workout . finally  thankfully  the end flashed on the screen . what happened next  you got it  shots of the women working out . not even the end of the movie can stop them   br    br
