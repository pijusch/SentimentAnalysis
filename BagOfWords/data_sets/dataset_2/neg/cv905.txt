i love the book   jane eyre  and have seen many versions of it . all have their strong points and their faults . however  this was one of the worst i have seen . i didn  t care about jane or mr . rochester . charlotte gainsbourg  jane  was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part  but she had no emotion in any of her lines . i couldn  t imagine what mr . rochester saw in her .  br    br   that brings us to mr . rochester . william hurt had even less emotion than jane  if that were possible . how two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery  but it certainly didn  t hold my attention . perhaps the director  zeffrelli  fell asleep during the production .  br    br   the timothy dalton  too handsome for mr . rochester   version is far more faithful to the book  but ciaran hinds plays the perfect mr . rochester in the     a  e version  which is not all that true to the book  .  br    br   trying to find something positive about this movie geraldine chaplain was perfect in her role .
