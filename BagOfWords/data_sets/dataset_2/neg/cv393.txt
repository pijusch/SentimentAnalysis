i was browsing through netflix and stumbled upon this movie . having fond memories of the book as a child  i decided to check this out . this is a movie that you should really pass on .  br    br   it is just not worth seeing . it is very boring and uninteresting . i feel that it would even be that way to small children . it has no magic that the book contains . this movie is not horrible  but you will just find yourself not caring ten minutes into it .  br    br   there are moments that just come off as weird . the witch character is not very good . the family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening . i know this is a kids movie  so as an older audience we must not look too deeply in things  but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any movie making experience before .  br    br   the dvd that i had began skipping in the final moments of the film  and instead of trying to fix it i just turned it off and sent it back to netflix . i really didn  t care how it finished . skip this film and read the book instead .
