this is a film that makes you say  things . . .   i can do much better than this  acting  writing and directing    this is so bad i must leave a review and warn others . . .  br    br   looks as if it was shot with my flip video . i have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me . i have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film . one of the worst  movies i have ever seen . hopefully the writers and director leave the business . not even talented enough to do commercials
