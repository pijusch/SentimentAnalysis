be warned this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence .  br    br   the only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways .  br    br   each story has only a few minutes  so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot . just an sketchy idea of a plot . the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer . however  that just didn  t work out because you didn  t get to know the characters in before or these  jokes  were just silly .  br    br   this is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart . a dozen times . or even more  i don  t know and i don  t care .
