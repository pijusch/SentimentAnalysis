i just watched this movie on starz . let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved the acting  writing  directing  special effects  camera crew  sound  and lighting . it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie . apparently back in      when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for    million . now  a  days those things cost about   billion and they cant go invisible . apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour . there was a completely random lesbian scene  which i didn  t mind  but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it . the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes . oh yeah  since its a steven segal movie  its predictable as hell . all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane .
