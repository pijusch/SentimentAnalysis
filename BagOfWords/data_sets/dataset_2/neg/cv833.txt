after some internet surfing  i found the  homefront  series on dvd at ioffer . com . before anyone gets excited  the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv   years ago . the resolution and quality are poor . the images look like you would expect old re  recorded video to look . although the commercials were edited out  the ending credits of each episode still have voice  over announcements for the segway into the abc news program  nightline   complete with the top news headlines from the early      s . even with the poor image quality  the shows were watch  able and the sound quality was fine .  br    br   to this show  s credit  the casting was nearly perfect . everyone was believable and really looked the part . their acting was also above average . the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler  most recently seen in the     remake of king kong  . the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets  especially the     s kitchens with vintage appliances and dcor . the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time . for example  conversations between characters were sometimes inter  cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes . the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations . that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case .  br    br   as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it   years ago . despite all the ingredients for a fine show  the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start . for one thing  the name of the show itself is totally misleading . when wwii ended in      there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a  homefront  either . curiously  the first episode of the show  homefront  begins in     after the war had ended . that  s like shooting the first episode of  gilligan  s island  showing the castaways being rescued . the whole premise of the show  s namesake is completely lost . i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no  the entire show takes place from     through     . additionally  this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late      s . by the third episode  it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left  wing political agenda . the show is set in river run ohio  near toledo . however  the show  s ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio . part of the ensemble cast are dick williams  hattie winston and sterling macer jr . who portray the davis family . much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil  whites  to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable . the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over   years . we get it . we  re also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis . the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show  as it was for  homefront  . the acting talents of williams  winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical  frightened  angry black family  . the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kkk member or something . the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist  fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing  and leave it at that . devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid .  br    br   in yet another ridiculous plot line  the big boss of a local factory  ken jenkins  is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees . the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro  communist propaganda message to the viewer .  br    br   personally  i think this series had great potential . the writers could have easily placed the timeline in          as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working   hour days at war factories . of course the loss of brothers  sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama . the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or uso personnel passing through their town during training or en  route to europe or the pacific . the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless . but no  the writers of homefront  david assael and james grissom  completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots . instead  they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left  wing politics . it would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage .
