i rented this movie last week . i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it  so it seemed promising . and it was  until justin timberlake came on scene . he is a really bad actor and shouldn  t be allowed to make a movie ever again . i mean  he is one of the most boring  uninspired actors i  ve ever seen . he puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever . why the hell was he cast for the role of josh pollack  i think matt damon would have been a better choice .  br    br   kevin spacey was another big disappointment . his character is so dull  it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in se  en . it might sound cool  but believe me  it  s not .  br    br   now  dylan mcdermott  s acting is very good . it  s about one of the very few good things about this movie . he is just inspired .  br    br   morgan freeman is good but nothing special . he has some really cool lines though .  br    br   about the story  although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good . i was expecting a big twist when lazerov  dylan mcdermott  was killed  but nothing really happened .
