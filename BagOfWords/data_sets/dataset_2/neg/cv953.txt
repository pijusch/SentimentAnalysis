this is another of the many b minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it . all aspects of the film  script  acting  direction  are mediocre . the acting by the three leads is wooden . i guess john dall was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing tv work . lee j cobb who is usually terrific cannot rise above the poor script and poor direction . jane wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers . the movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that i have ever seen  the one in which john dall goes after lee j cobb is particularly strange . the dvd transfer is typical alpha .
