this movie is a terrible waste of time . although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to  . i have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose . this is also a  horror  film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight . my friend and i laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared .  br    br   the only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries . it cannot be that high in demand .  br    br   the supermodel nicole petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie  half of the time she is british and half the time she is american .
