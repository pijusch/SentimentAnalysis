the movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between . but the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable .  br    br   but krista allen really rocked in the movie . her voice was so seducing and sexy . the scenes in the bed involving krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than any one could do . krista really is one of the best in such roles . she also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last  minutes  which is the interesting part of the movie .  br    br   burt reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star . he could have chosen a better script than this . ireally think he did for money .
