i got all excited when i saw the ads for this movie because i recently read the book and really enjoyed it . the movie  however  did not meet my expectations . having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies . the characters didn  t seem to fit very well with the book . the direction was weak . i had a hard time getting into the characters . there wasn  t a real connection with the viewer about what was going on . the dialog didn  t explain adequately what was happening . it just seemed slapped together and rushed through . all in all i was very disappointed with the movie . i suppose if you haven  t read the book  it might be ok by itself . at the very least  it might entice you to read the book  which you  ll probably enjoy more .  br    br
