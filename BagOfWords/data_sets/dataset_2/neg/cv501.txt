i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie  rocked  . it is pure cg over  acted crap  don  t send an assassin  it  s much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored  aggressive  venomous snakes on a plane  the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to . it is not  so bad it  s good  it  s so bad i  d rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again . i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane  a spoof  was i wrong . it  s that whole  it sucks  get it   or samuel a . jackson yells  snakes on the plane  thing . well i  m sorry  i don  t get it . it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard . if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hung  s cd  still live in their mommies basement  and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn  then rush to the theater and ask for one  since i doubt you have a girlfriend  ticket for snakes on a stupid  butt plane . to hell with movies like full metal jacket  pulp fiction  true romance    monkeys  clerks  etc . there  s no irony in watching good movies . the true decline of the western civilization . calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man  or even orgazmo . i  ve said enough here .
