i don  t remember a movie where i have cared less about where the characters have come from  what happens to them or where they are going . i realize that hollywood  s greatest pastime is navel  gazing  but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take up time with . for what it  s worth  though  the discussion that followed the showing  under the auspices of the key sunday cinema series  did make allowance that possibly the three women did show some redeeming characteristics . i disagree .
