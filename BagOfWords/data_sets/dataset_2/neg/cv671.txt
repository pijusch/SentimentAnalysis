this time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world . i  m pretty sure it was double team  which convinced everyone that jean  claude van damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks . however it was this that tarnished his credibility forever . while universal soldierthe return isn  t as dull as double team or the quest  it  s still pretty awful indeed  with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing . this sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling . as i look back  not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud . in other words another clunker in van damme  s assembly line .  br    br    out of   bad
