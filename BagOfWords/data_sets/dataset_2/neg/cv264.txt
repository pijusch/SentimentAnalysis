this movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning  but never fleshed out to it  s expectations . the director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas  typical of the asian directors   but doesn  t know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it . the story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film  never finding a solid  explainable  interesting angle . basically  the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases . the acting was very good  however . all the actors gave good performances  and jude law was outstanding as he is always is . it is too bad he chose to do such a weak film .
