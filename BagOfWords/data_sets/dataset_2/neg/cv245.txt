first of all  this film can be divided into three segments . a promising opening  with the ambushing of some cavalry by the cheyenne . this is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section  with the totally miscast candice bergen and  soldier blue  traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison . miss bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth  and looks like she just walked out of a     s jack nicholson movie . i mean she maintains zero interest  with zero believability . the third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian village . this is so obviously overdone to lay on the anti  war propaganda  that it comes across as simply long  outrageous  and contrived . not recommended .  merk . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . jacobe  comment above  here  s an idea . why don  t you actually watch the movie you are commenting on  instead of chirping your liberal nonsense . this is not a political site  it is for reviewing films .  merk
