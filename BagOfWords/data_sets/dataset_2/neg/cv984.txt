 . . . . . . this film is pretty awful  the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of  was the fact that i unfortunately have seen worse .  br    br   the jungle music  juttering demons  and fluorescent uv style blood  teeth  eyes give it that  awful  look  and the script is dire . . . . . this film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it . it  s also predictable but not in a good way . nothing this film does is in a good way . i watched it   minutes ago and thought i would rant a bit so there you are .  oh and the acting doesn  t let the film down  it  s also terrible
