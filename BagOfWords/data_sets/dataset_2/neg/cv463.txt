this would  ve been a great silent film . the acting really is good  at least in a look ma  i  m doing really big acting  sort of way .  br    br   everything is huge . every line is profound  every scene is shattered by human tragedy   br    br   mostly  i felt like gagging . yet  like any train wreck  i couldn  t tear my eyes away . this dialogue might  ve worked on the stage  although i doubt it . on the screen  it was cluttered  haphazard  hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work .  br    br   if you enjoy your melodrama in huge  heaping doses  you might enjoy the movie . be prepared to wait  however . for all that melodrama  this thing sure plods along at its own pace .  br    br   this script must  ve sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves . it simply doesn  t work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera .  br    br   imdb does us a great disservice  at times  when it uses its goofy computer  controlled  weighted score  . curse of the starving class deserves less than a  .  br    br   character  driven fiction is great  but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution  it isn  t character development  your characters must have a motivation . being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not character development . that  s a plot contrivance .  br    br   stay away from this movie . or at the very least  watch it muted . perhaps you  ll get some amusement from all the arm  waving the characters do .  br    br   oh  and word to the wise   to prove that this is truly an artsy film  you see james woods in all his dangly male  look  at  me  i  m  the  figurative  and  literal  representation  of  the  naked  vulnerability  of  man  glory .  br    br   don  t say you weren  t warned .
