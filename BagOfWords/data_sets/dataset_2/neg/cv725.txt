one two three four five six seven eight and back  haha . this is a must see  first of all to see the work out . there are a lot of work out shown  see those close ups  man you will enjoy it . a few years ago a video clip was surely based on this movie . it  s a slasher but without suspense . the ending is funny too  and the clothes she  s wearing in the wood confronting the copper  jesus  looks like a clown . the killings are mostly done off screen  the blood flows but never too gory . there are a lot of fight scene  s too  and hey  no one got hurt . and what about the weapon to kill  never seen a big one like that  won  t spoil it  you must see it . and being a slasher there  s a lot of ta too . to guess who  s the killer you will be trapped a few times and that  s the best part  but what about the story of the copper in the woods  huh  but still due his cheesiness this one is still one that many would like to have . i  m glad that i have my copy  one of those slasher failures . but man  those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles  if you are in your    s then this is one is back to memory lane .
