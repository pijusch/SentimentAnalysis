timberlake  s performance almost made attack the screen . it wasn  t all bad  i just think the reporters role was wrong for him .  br    br   ll cool j played the typical rapper role  toughest  baddest guy around . i don  t think the cracked a smile in the whole movie  not even when proposed to his girlfriend .  br    br   morgan freeman pretty much carried the whole movie . he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie .  br    br   kevin spacey wasn  t good or bad he was just  there  .  br    br   overall it  s a dull movie . bad plot . a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors .
