i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb . but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone  s been fixing the score .  br    br   either way it was a real disappointment . the movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest . there really is no reason to give a summary of the plot  but here goes it felt like someone had been thinking  wouldn  t it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane  and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff     and that  s about it  the plot is thin and unoriginal . the snakes are bad cgi  but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone   . the acting is poor  and all people are unbelievable stereo types .  br    br   to sum it up it  s one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen  stay away
