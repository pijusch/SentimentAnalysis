i saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless . an ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas  the victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man . they drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or  duh  burn him . quentin alias mr . fabersham of the honeymooners is married to diane brewster alias miss canfield of leave it to beaver fame  who is unhappy in marriage . wow  love plot . the rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid . the egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film . where is the mummy  really just a curse unleashed . this does not hold a torch to universal mummy films in the least . watch this movie if you need sleep  because you will dose off .
