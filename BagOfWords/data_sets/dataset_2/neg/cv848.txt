i  ll give writer  director william gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill  conceived  thriller .  a good argument for not wasting money subscribing to hbo  let alone buying dvds based on cover art and blurbs . a pedestrian dennis hopper and a game richard grieco add nothing significant to their resumes  although the art direction is not half bad . the dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit this is storytelling at its worst . no tension  no suspense  no dread  no fear  no empathy  no catharsis  no nothing . a few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom  but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer . i feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing . good for late  night  zoned  out viewing only . you have been warned .
