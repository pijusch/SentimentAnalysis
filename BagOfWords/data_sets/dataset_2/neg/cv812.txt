the movie is basically the story of a russian prostitute  s return to her home village for the funeral of a sister  friend . there are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken  but they are not fully explored . the core of the movie is the funeral  wake  and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable . apparently  the movie is unedited . the prostitute  s journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud . maybe that  s supposed to impress us with the immensity of the russian landscape . the village itself  such as it is  is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male  the consort of the dead girl . continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible . most of the film is shot with a hand  held camera that could induce nausea . another problem for western viewers is that subtitles don  t include the songs and laments of the crones . don  t go to this movie unless you  re fluent in russian .
