what a pathetic movie .  br    br   i won  t waste much time commenting about it . i  m still trying to get back the couple hours i wasted on it .  br    br   let me leave it simply with  shaq has no business being an actor or singer . he is utterly without talent at both discplines . it  s a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut cds .  br    br   much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no  talent that is shaq .
