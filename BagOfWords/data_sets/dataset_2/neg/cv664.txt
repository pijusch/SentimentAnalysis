 here be spoilers   br    br   the government has continued to develop the universalsoldier program  now called unisol . the soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before . however the government is downsizing  the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened  so he takes steps to ensure his own safety . he activates and controls the unisols and start to run mayhem . the only one who can stop them is deveraux  van damme  .  br    br   this movie is about one thing . choreographed fighting . the story is bad  and is soon drowned in all fights . whatever happens  and wherever they go  they fight . unfortunately for this movie  it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible . normally you  re pretty sure the hero will win  but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants . not where one is indestructible and can  t lose . then the fights just become a tool to stretch time . you wait until the final fight when deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes . to further lower my opinion  a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are . well  there aren  t really that lot of them  because the characters are most men  there are at least one woman unisol though   but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once . the female leads get by with this  but we also pass through a strip  club  to use a computer no less  with much more undressed women . these moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent  minded male audience .  br    br   so  in conclusion  boring fights . no more  no less . well  maybe less . . .  br    br
