let me give a quick summery of the film a rotten  rude kid named max stumbles upon a radio that contains kazaam a rapping genie . like all genies  he grants  wishes but  being good natured  also helps max with his personal life  as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime . during all this  kazaam raps from time to time   also showcasing shaq  s dismal rap skills  .  br    br   this movie proves what we all know athletes need to stick to sports . i admit that it never looked like an oscar  worthy movie  but everything about this waste of film is horrible . the characters are either unlikable or stupid  the plot is not even worth mentioning  the dialog is a joke  and shaq is only a quarter of the problem . hell  even if denzel washington played kazaam this movie would still be a joke . i know that the movie only drew anybody was because shaq was so big  no pun intended  at the time . i honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time . shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws .
