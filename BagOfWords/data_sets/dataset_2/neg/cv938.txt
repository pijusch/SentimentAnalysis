it surprisingly had a plot    i  ve seen movies with less plot  i don  t wanna mention asian movies but . . .  . i thought the camera wasn  t bad at all for a cheap movie like this  and also the atmosphere wasn  t too bad . there is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens . although i do think that about a lot of movies  in this case it was horrible  of course .  br    br   it ripped off some movies so badly just for single scenes . the acting was bad but i  ve seen worse . the movie was bad but i  ve seen worse . watching this film is an experience between boredom  laughing fits  death wish  sadism  horniness and entertainment on a low level .  br    br   so if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for you .  br    br   i gave it      because it can be entertaining if you don  t expect to see a good movie and you  re in the right mood .
