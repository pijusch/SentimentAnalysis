this movie was probably the worst movie i have ever seen . here are the things that immediately jump out at me  . the woods were more like hills in los angeles with a couple trees and brush . not scary whatsoever . news flash  if you are filming in the southern california area  big bear is only an hour away . they actually have trees there .  br    br    . the writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue i have ever experienced . every possible line in the movie was unoriginal  clich  or just plain stupid . for instance the name of the camp is  camp blood   lame   the name of the clown is  the killer clown   lame  . what is a clown doing in a forest anyway  was that the only mask they could find   . the last but certainly the least was the acting . absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled . a virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting . worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph . it  s a really long scene and i guess she was supposed to be sexy  but she was not . also  and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me  was this tool who is supposed to be  athletic .  for instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them . then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very  girl like  run  that he is quite far from athletic . oh and to the girl who played kat  good lord stop singing . that song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself .  br    br   if for some reason you do see this movie  i would at least recommend watching the special features . the group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story . in fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending . apparently she hangs out with special kids .
