with a story and screenplay that seems to have been written by a high schooler   the art of seduction  fails to deliver the romantic  sophisticated experience it tries to bill itself as . the two main characters have the potential to be interesting  both male and female lead are  swinging singles  or in the female lead  s case  engaged    but  the art of seduction  doesn  t even try . shirking from a frank examination of these two characters  personalities   the art of seduction  eschews anything of substance for a basis of thin  lean stereotype .  br    br    the art of seduction  is insulting  insulting to its characters  insulting to men and women  and insulting to its audiences  expectations . it takes the awful beautiful people we all know and plays out their painful interactions while expecting us to idolize them . ji  wan is an immature  spoiled  manipulative bitch . the viewer is expected to like and forgive her flaws because she  s pretty . min  jun  well  he  s exactly the same . neither are nice people . the  humour  in this film primarily revolve around ji  wan and min  jun  s outlandish attempts at outdoing each other in the honourable art of lying and manipulation . no character development occurs  and we never learn why ji  wan and min  jun are like this . we are simply expected to take them as they are  and not ask questions  they  re cute   and that  s all that matters . the copious references to the celebrity of the main actors in azn cinema scenester  s reviews may tip you off to  art of seduction  s shallowness .  br    br   if you  re still in high school  you liked grease  or you are a yellow fever victim  you may like this movie .  br    br   despite its  romance  tag  this is not a very good date movie .
