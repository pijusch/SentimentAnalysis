so . . . we get so see added footage of brando . . . interesting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff . susannah york was hardly a slouch . new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn  t notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets . real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that . . . let  s listen to donner make fun of lester  s version that made more logical sense . the president talks of the zod  defacing  the washington monument when it was originally mount rushmore . tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd . superman  s  freedom of the press  line sounded silly compared to  . . care to step outside  which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to clark  s earlier scene in the truck stop . then there is the ending with the  turn back the world to go back in time  effect . it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for hackensack  n . j . ever went since it doesn  t free zod and company any more .
