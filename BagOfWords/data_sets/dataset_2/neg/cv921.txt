i think i  ve seen all of the grisham movies now and generally they  re all very poor  except for the rainmaker  but this one is so bad it  s unbelievable  br    br   warning spoilerish  br    br   it  s one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do . he  s a lawyer for christ  s sake . why when his children go missing does he not call the police . oh yes it  s because all the police hate lawyers so they  re just ignore him and let him be attacked .  br    br   when he  s arrested for murder they just let him go free  he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing .  br    br   why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home .  br    br   the police don  t bother to try and find an escaped mental patient  they don  t bother to interview his daughter .  br    br   as for the ridiculous ending .  br    br   in summary  silly  very unrealistic and a complete waste of time .  br    br        one of the worst films ever made .
