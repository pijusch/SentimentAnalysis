  magnolia  is a preposterous  bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little . like  eyes wide shut    magnolia  is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence . the camera swoops through hallways and corridors  catching glimpses of sad characters . where is the reason to care for these people  the common theme seems to be people who yell a lot  who can  t care for others  except for john c . reilly  s and philip seymour hoffman  s characters   and are self  destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying . i was reminded of how much i disliked  shine  because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by armin mueller  stahl . there are so many unattractive  unappealing characters here  why would we want to spend time with them   br    br   having said that  there is nothing held back about  magnolia .  paul thomas anderson  s ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon . there are two ideas in particular that bomb . both happen in the last hour of this     minute film . one has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of aimee mann  s coffeehouse folk songs . sweet  but ineffectual since we can  t see what strings them all together . the other idea i refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous .  br    br    magnolia  has a lot of great acting . particularly tom cruise who unleashes a performance i didn  t know he had in him . and john c . reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory . but it all adds up to nothing . when the secret unexpected event happened  a girl behind me in the theatre couldn  t hold it in any more and said   this is stupid   my feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree .
