many people thought that this is a good movie but i don  t agree with them . at the beginning of the movie  a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship  then hey killed some people on the earth  but for no reason . also  it is in a dark forest  i can  t see anything on the screen  i can only hardly hear the sound .  br    br   after a few days  the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that  he should not know what happened on the earth  so there is a contradiction . finally  the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason . he was not live on earth  t is none of his business about the things happened here . lastly  the duration of the movie is only   minutes long  the summary is too short and it can  t tell the reviewers about the story clearly .  br    br   in conclusion  i don  t think this is a good movie .
