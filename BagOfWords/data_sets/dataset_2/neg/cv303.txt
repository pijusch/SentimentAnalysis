when it comes to horror movies  i am more than willing to suspend disbelief  ignore sub  par production values  and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare . this movies simply has no good scares to offer . it can  t even be enjoyed as camp . bad dialogue  bad acting  bad direction  the kills were predictable and poorly staged  the music was annoying  the camera work was wretched  even the costumes were bad . i felt really bad for the actors  who were obviously trying  but who had to deal with terrible  contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction . i doubt they got any rehearsal  either . it  s embarrassing to watch  and so boring than making it through to the contrived  surprise  ending requires tremendous endurance . it  s quite easily one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen .  br    br   i don  t normally write reviews  but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others . this movie is a complete waste of time . if you must watch this movie  don  t miss the  making of   featurette . the writer  director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold  daring move .  seen it .  he and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it  s a new  age  citizen kane .  it  s like listening to a group of third  graders take you behind the scenes of their christmas pageant . they truly think they  ve created something of substance . it  s sad  really the only reason i gave this movie a    is because i think    should be reserved for true atrocities  like  manos hands of fate  and  space mutiny .  so  american nightmare  isn  t the worst movie i  ve ever seen  but i  d have to say that it  s somewhere in the bottom fifty .
