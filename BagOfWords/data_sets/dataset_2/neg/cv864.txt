i found this film to be an utter dissapointment . the talent available to the director  notably stanley tucci  chris walken  hank azaria and alan arkin  without even mentioning the four main leads   have been completely wasted on an unfunny  mediocre story  whose conclusion one couldn  t really care about once introduced to the dire  stereo  typed characters . julia roberts is feeble  zeta  jones is just plain annoying  appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity  minus the humour   crystal just plays his same old hyper  active  neurotic  annoying alter  ego and cusack simply walks through his part  apparently bored with the whole project .  br    br   for what is supposed to be a  romantic comedy   there is absolutely no romance between the central characters  let alone chemistry  and as for the comedy   possible spoilers  well  the only moments of mild humour came off the back of cusack  s role in grosse pointe and his relationship with alan arkin  the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever .  spoilers  azaria was reasonably amusing as the mexican lover and walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse  maverick  dogme type director  but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead  spoilers  we were treated to billy crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog . pure genius .  br    br   for a huge fan of the majority of john cusack  s work  not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast  i was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas  and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them  instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost  gross  out  teen  movie  humour at times .  br    br   a very poor     .
