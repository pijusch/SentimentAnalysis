being an elvis fan  i can  t understand how this proyect could be done . is by far the worst elvis related movie of all time  totally unfunny  silly and plenty of mistakes about the king . come on  elvis  grave in a public park  a mention about suspicious minds in      . . . and these are just two examples . some people in the cast tries to do their best  mike starr is funny  specially as an impersonator   the tom hanks cameo is a surprise  but the guy playing the young elvis sucks . overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute . if you want to see an ultra cheap  insane but absolutely funny little film related to elvis  i truly recommend you  bubba ho  tep  instead of this mess .
