this is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues . that is no exaggeration you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it .  br    br   i sincerely thought fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does erwin  elvira suicides at the end  but instead of this  in every scene somebody is trying to explain  when he was young  this happened . . .  and  he just came back from casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there . . .   etc .  br    br   soon in the movie  erwin  elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute  certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat   and while telling her the story of elvira  s life  fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other . it is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying . of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of  i have suffered much in my life  and am about to die  .  br    br   in one of the sparse moments where actually happens something  erwin  elvira encounters a former lover  that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys  as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality  is that he recognizes elvira .  br    br   there are some interesting shots and ideas  i must admit  such as when the nun tells the story of the young erwin   but everything on the movie is wasted due to fassbinder  s self  indulgence .
