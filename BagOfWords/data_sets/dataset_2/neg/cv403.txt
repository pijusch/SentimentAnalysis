i have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the wrinkle in time chronicles . my dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading a winkle in time  and would think  what an amazing movie this would make . sadly enough that screenwriter failed  changing characters  throwing in lame humor  and all out destroying the plot . i know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie . but why can  t you stay true to the book  why must you change the way characters think and act  for those of you who have not read the book  pick it up  find a soft couch  and let your imagination run wild .
