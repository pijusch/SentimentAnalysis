sorry did i miss something  did i walk out early  the first ten minutes of unusual  and untrue   stories had me thinking  this is going to be a classic  but it was all down hill from there  the acting was brilliant  for what it  s worth william h macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every film i watch him in . but it never seemed to connect . i was waiting for the big moment where all the stories inter connect and then suddenly . . it rains frog   it was if the writer said  i  ve gone to deep how can i pull all these stories together cleverely . . . . oh sod it i  ll just have it raining frogs  . i like clever movies  i like strange movies but this was just odd and boring .
