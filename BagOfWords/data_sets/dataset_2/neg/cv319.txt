first of all i just want to say that i love this show    but this episode . . . this episode makes a mockery of the entire show .  br    br   i don  t know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the worst episode in the entire series .  br    br   there is no story line  everything is chaotic and the jokes . . . . . are crap .  br    br   the way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game . . . . . for example  how do the furlings look like  by creating that stupid  previously on . . .  . . . . . . is simply embarrassing .  br    br   its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad .
