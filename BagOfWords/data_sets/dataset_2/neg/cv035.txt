i just saw the movie in theater . the movie has very few good points to talk about . kareena  s beauty and a couple of songs may be . thats it . the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas . anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed  even mumbai indians too  just now chennai has made it to semi  final  .  br    br   but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes . now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood . but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real . but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time . they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie . now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people . but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work . all the action scenes i wish i could have forwarded . at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar . this is height of stupidity . audience is not paying to watch such stupidity . i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies . they cant make it . the last good action i have seen was from  ghatak  and  khiladiyon ka khialdi  . the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me . does these people see their movie after completion  can  t they figure out that the slow motion action  which is done using ropes  is too unrealistic and childish  better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it . i just want to go back to amitabh  s era where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scenes . the sound effect was not very effective in those days  but visually it is much better than current era scenes .  br    br   this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors . please don  t make any more action movies  until you acquire the art of making it realistic .
