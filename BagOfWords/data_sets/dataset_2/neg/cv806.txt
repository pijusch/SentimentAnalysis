i agree with the previous comment  the beginning of the movie is quite good  and get  s you wandering about what is to come . . . . . . . which is nothing . all open story lines remain open two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture  save for  or  very short scenes . i wander if ilya wouldn  t have done better to just completely leave them out . . . . as for the one remaining character  nothing is done with her either . she just visits some god  awful place  and suddenly the movie isn  t about her anymore  but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread  drinking homemade vodka  and apparently flashing each other . some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling  like the judges of the iffr  but for me it is just bad taste  bad camera  work  a lousy script and frightfully bad direction . therefor i can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading
