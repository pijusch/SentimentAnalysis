so i  m looking to rent a dvd and i come across this movie called  end game  . it stars james woods and cuba gooding jr and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller . well worth a look then . or so i thought .  br    br   boy  was i wrong .  br    br   end game has just about the most ridiculous plot i have ever had the displeasure of enduring . now being something of a whodunnit  i can  t really tear into it as i would like without  ruining  it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity . but questions such as  why has he  she  they done this    and  where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off   are all too abundant following the film  s unintentionally hilarious conclusion .  br    br   as for the acting  you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor  s realised that they  ve made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie  and this then shows in their performance  this is one of those . accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed  irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison .  br    br   of course  this didn  t make it to the cinema  and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room it is appalling .
