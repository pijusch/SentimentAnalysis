i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted . so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that  it is the directorial debut of vijay krishna acharya who wrote the screenplays for dhoom    and saif ali khan  s son ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback  .  br    br   after watching it  i understood that why their wasn  t a proper trailer because there wasn  t anything in the film to show . the story was extremely dum and even a   year old child can come up with a better story  line . there was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it  s difficult to figure out that who is killing who . also the action was daft  unrealistic e . g .  man with a handgun managed to kill about    men with machine guns .  br    br   while i was watching tashan it reminded me of  films  br    br   sin city during the opening credits .  br    br   koyla anil kapoor  s terrible english like amrish puri in koyla .  br    br   jhoom barabar jhoom the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny .  br    br   i also heard the budget is   crores which is the same amount as dhoom  and i don  t know where all the money went to . anyway if you did not like dhoom  then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan . race was hot on heels and that is a million times better .  br    br   the only  good songs are dil haara  challiya and both songs are shot in greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film  even anil kapoor  s terrible english couldn  t save this discomfiture .
