unless you are between the ages of   and    except for the r rating   there are very few things to like here . one or two lines from kenan thompson  david koechner  we really should see him more  and sam jackson are humorous and julianna margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings  but sadly  that  s it . poor plot . poor acting . worse writing and delivery . the special effects are dismal . as much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke  the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible . if we consider the action portions  well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan . this movie only contains the latter kind . this leaves little left . i  m so glad i did not pay for this .  br    br   despite any hype  i can read and think  so as i sat down to watch  i did not expect anything good . i had no expectations  but was somewhat worried going in . yet  like a train wreck  one cannot merely look away . and even with no expectations  i was let down . bad . not even  so bad  it  s good  material . i  m  very  tolerant of bad movies  but this makes  six string samurai   which i liked  oscar worthy .  br    br   no  this piece of over cgi  d rubbish is in the same company as battlefield earth  little man and gigli . how this is currently rated a  .  completely mystifies me . brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that i can think of as answers .  br    br   i could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight  i witnessed a train wreck . i need to go wash my eyes .  of
