maybe it  s the dubbing  or maybe it  s the endless scenes of people crying  moaning or otherwise carrying on  but i found europa    to be one of the most overwrought  and therefore annoying  films i  ve ever seen . the film starts out promisingly if familiarly  as mom ingrid bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son  sandro franchina  . whilst mummy and daddy  bland alexander knox  entertain their guests at a dinner party  the youngster tries to kill himself  setting in motion a life changing series of events that find bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy . spurred on by communist newspaper editor andrea  ettore giannini   she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband  who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles . bergman plays the saint role to the hilt  echoing her     role as joan of arc  and rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect . unfortunately  the script pounds its point home with ham  fisted subtlety  as andrea and mom take turns declaiming marxist and christian platitudes . by the final tear soaked scene  i had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters . a real step down for rossellini as he stepped away from neo  realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of      s flowers of st . francis .
