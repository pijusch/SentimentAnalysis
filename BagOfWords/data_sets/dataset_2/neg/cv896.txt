this movie has successfully proved what we all already know  that professional basket  ball players suck at everything besides playing basket  ball . especially rapping and acting . i can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is . first of all  is it just me  or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen  i mean  his teeth could be used as a can  opener . secondly  why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when  even though he has magical powers  he sucks horribly at making music  third  i have read the bible . in no way shape or form did it say that jesus made genies . fourth  what was the deal with all the crappy special effects  i assure you that any acne  addled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that . fifth  why did the ending suck so badly  and what the hell is a djin  and finally  whoever created the nightmare known as kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the eiffel tower  because this movie take the word  suck  to an entirely new level .
