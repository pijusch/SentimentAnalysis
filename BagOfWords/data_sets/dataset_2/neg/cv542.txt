i have absolutely no knowledge of author phillipa pearce or any of her novels and if toms midnight garden is typical of her work i probably would have had little interest in her books as a child . when i was a child i wasnt really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count  br    br   judging by this film version of toms midnight garden i guess pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist tom long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one . having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didnt have in the     s so i guess theres some political class ridden subtext there somewhere . theres also a romance involving a young girl called hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories  perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative  br    br   this is a childrens film that seems dated by its source . its inoffensive but im surprised by its high rating by the imdb voters . i wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were   year olds whod just seen the lord of the rings trilogy
