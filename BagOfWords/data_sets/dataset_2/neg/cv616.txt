first of all i love good splattermovies and am not afraid to get in touch with art  but this zero  budget  flick is none of it  the picture  quality is so damned low  the soundtrack the most annoying one i ever       heard  and as for the fx . . . well the super  low quality makes some of them look not as bad as they would in a real movie  what this junk here isn  t  . no concept  a wafer  thin storyline  primitive acting and rare dialog  i think i counted about   sentences in the whole movie  each one repeated about   times . . . same for a lot of film  sequences  may be an indication for which kind of audience this crap was made     the story seems to be that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother  got psychological damaged and as an adult goes touring  performing a show of self  mutilation . so far  so good . . . but for these pseudo  art  idiot  directors  this plot is just a line to put cheap produced shock scenes in a row which neither have a message nor make any sense  freshly taken  out bowels are thrown on a naked  bound woman in an earth  hole . . . why   and why is that the only time you see both woman and thrower in the whole bloody  movie      disturbing  yes   sick  yes   necessary  no  artistically  no      everyone mistaking this cheap gore  show for art should as soon as possible visit his psychiatrist or should watch pink floyd  s  the wall  to see how a similar topic can be worked out in an artful way . . . i hope this was your first and last           movie  andrew cobb . . .     and all you gore  heads out there  remember not everything that looks cheap and makes obviously no sense at all is automatically  art  . . .
