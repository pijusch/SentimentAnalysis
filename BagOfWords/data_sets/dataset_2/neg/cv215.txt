this   minute documentary buuel made in the early      s about one of spain  s poorest regions is  in my opinion  one of his weakest films . first  let  s admit that   years later  spain is much richer than it was then  and when i say this  i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own  like excessive individualism and consumerism  though all in all wealth it  s a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here  . and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that buuel favored  but with western european style capitalism . but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene  the narrator chides that in school  children are taught the value of pi . teaching math to poor people  the horror  . buuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here  not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation . what is he proposing  that children are taught exactly what at school  doesn  t buuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people
