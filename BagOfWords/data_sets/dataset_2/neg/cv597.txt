the first power       was a terrible film that came out during the late    s  early    s era of cheaply made horror films . i found this movie very boring but extremely hilarious in some parts . this movie lacks so much sense and credibility that it ain  t even funny . the swift justice system in this film makes texas look weak by comparison . lou diamond phillips is in way over his head with this role  he plays a hard  boiled cop  and tracey griffith  melanie  s more attractive sister  plays a psychic . don  t waste your time with this one because it  s bad . what a minute  i take it back . this movie makes a great party film . check out the switchblade crucifix packing nun  she has the nicest legs i  ve ever seen on a nun that wasn  t in a jesus franco nunsploitation flick . yeow   br    br   this marked an end of an era for l . d . p . his star was tarnished and he couldn  t draw flies to a dung heap . it was d . t . v . for him until his  ressurection  a few years later .  br    br   not recommended unless you  re desperate .
