what the hell of a d  movie was that  bad acting  bad special effects and the worst dialogues  storyline i ever came across . the only cool thing here was coolio  who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop . however  the rest of the film is awful and boring . it  s not even so bad  you can laugh about it . just plain crap . and whoever compares this to the evil dead series might as well compare tomb raider to indiana jones  well  ok  at least there was angelina jolie in tomb raider    out of
