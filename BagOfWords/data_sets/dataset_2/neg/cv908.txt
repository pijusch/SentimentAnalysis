having read the novel before seeing this film  i was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot . i feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of bronte  s work  and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story . in the condensing of the film to a short  hours  the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional  thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding . there is no build up to the romance between rochester and jane eyre  so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their  love  is superficial . this is such an injustice to bronte  s novelyou are given no impression of jane  s quirky cheek and boldness which attracts rochester to her  and his arrogance which attracts jane to him .  br    br   despite to poor scripting  i think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely  namely mrs fairfax and grace poole  however overall the production was poor . given a better scripting  perhaps the film would have been more successful . see  jane eyre        with zelah clarke and timothy dalton for an outstanding production .
