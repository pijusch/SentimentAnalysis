the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film   and even that was disappointing compared to some other films . my gawd   br    br   to me  this is the worst kind of film   one that assumes it  s a work of art because it has all the trappings of film  as  art . yes  it  s beautifully photographed  but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself . tango is a tease  it  s hot  it has drama  it  s audacious   precisely what this film is not .
