  stars out of a possible    and that is being overly generous .  br    br   i thought with a cast of james woods  cathy bates  randy quaid  lou gossett  jr .  and henry thomas  how could it miss . i was wrong .  br    br   i can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the week  end he cranked out this piece of dribble . i  d long suspected sam s . of being kind of nuts  this film  based on his play  confirms it .  br    br   this is the kind of artsy b . s . that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote . however  for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash  there is absolutely nothing to love about this movie .  br    br   you haven  t seen dysfunctional families until you  ve seen this bunch . pa is crazy  ma is crazy  the son is crazy and the daughter is  oh yeah  crazy . they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush  especially the teenage daughter .  br    br   in addition to the above  as if that weren  t enough  the plot   and it  s so thin you could read thorough it   has a hole in it the size of alaska .  br    br   ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm . as it turns out so is pa . now i don  t claim to be a real estate expert  but the last time i checked  property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold . if only one of them owned the property  then the other could not legally sell it  so it would be pointless for that person to do so . mr . shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact  and therefore  his plot does not work .  br    br   not that anything else was really working anyway .  br    br   the only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity  and i can  t imagine why anyone would want to .
