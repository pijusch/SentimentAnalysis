the only thing great about the movie is its title . in this case   snake on a plane  is example of not judging the book by its cover  the title says nothing about the movie . when i went to the theater  i wasn  t expecting citizen kane  i was expecting independence day  a movie that  s pure popcorn fun  but instead  i got that horrible roy liotta movie called  turbulence  yes  this is how bad soap is . the only thing make soap better is its title . and it  s not even the apporiate title for the movie  the wasn  t even a glimpse of  snake  or  plane    minutes into the movie  what a false advertising  if it wasn  t for its title  soap would be just another unforgettable cheap b  grade summer movie . and the r rating  it has to be the most undeserved r rated movie of all time  the makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a r  all of the violence are kept pg    level . you know what  s really r rated  the r rated superstar edge  see him at summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake
