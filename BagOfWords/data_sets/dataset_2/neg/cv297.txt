without a doubt this is one of the worst films i  ve ever wasted money on  the plot is  erm sorry  did i say there was a plot  the scariest moment was when . . .  nope can  t think of one  the best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was . . .  nope can  t think of one for that either . you knew who the killer was right from the start . there was nothing scary about the whole movie  in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister  misty  in the shower and when you saw nurse toppan take her top off . this film should only be watched to get an idea of how not to make a horror movie
