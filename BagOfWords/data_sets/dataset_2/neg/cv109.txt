thank god  i didn  t waste my money renting it but i downloaded it  this happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life  fg visual effects  unnecessary gore and nudity  far apart from other zombie movies like night of the living dead and others . there are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie . ok if you get time after reading this comment  please check out the director  s  ulli lommel  profile . after seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this  i mean every movie directed by ulli lommel gets a rating between  and  . and now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him  but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence . even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please do not watch this movie .
