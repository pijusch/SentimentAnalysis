booted out of heaven  a gang of horny naked female angels  with big plastic fangs  have taken up residence in a spooky forest where they feed upon any hapless souls who should wander by . it  s not long before a group of friends on a road trip are falling victim to the bloodthirsty babes an independent low budget horror made in the uk  forest of the damned takes an interesting premise and flushes it down the pan with some of the worst acting  effects and direction i have seen in a long time .  br    br   director johannes roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera  the scenes in the delapidated house are fairly tense and there are some deftly handled  shock  moments  but for the most part the film is technically amateurish . throw in some truly awful performances from horror icons tom savini and shaun hutson  and you have one real bad movie on your hands .  br    br   some fun may be derived from the film  s sheer shoddiness  and there is loads of female nudity for the guys to savour  but most will find this a chore to sit through .
