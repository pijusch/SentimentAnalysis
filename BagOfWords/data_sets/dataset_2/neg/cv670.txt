i tried to watch this movie twice and both times i still couldn  t make it to the end credits . first time i managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest . second time i managed to force myself to digest over an hours worth of shoddy acting  lame sfx and extremely poor direction . pales in comparison to the original .  br    br   anyone ever hear about the old et atari     fiasco  for those who haven  t let me fill you in . it  s     . . . et is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time . . . atari decides to release a movie tie  in game on their     home console system . to cut a long and financially painful story short the game flopped big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of atari     et games to be dumped in landfills because they couldn  t even give them away let alone sell them .  br    br   what does universal soldier the return have to do with this story  look at the  .  rating and figure it out for yourself .  br    br   awful film . . . imdb forced me to give it a  out of   because their rating systems doesn  t go as low as  let alone into the negatives .
