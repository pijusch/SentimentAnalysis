worst movie i have seen since gingerale afternoon . i suppose that this is a horror  comedy . i pretty much predicted every scene in this movie . the special  effects were not so special . i believe that i could come up with as good of effects from what i have lying around the house . i wish i could have something good to say about this movie  but i am afraid that i don  t . even coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey . i do  after a little thought  have one thing good to say about this movie  it ended .
