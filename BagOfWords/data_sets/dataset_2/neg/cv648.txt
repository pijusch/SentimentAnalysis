the only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic . everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out . i have actually seen better acting in low budget porn . i though i had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene jim watch your ass nick you watch yours  together   i wont leave you behind   br    br   the first action sequence shows how awful the production is  but its really kind of funny good guys have transformer weapons  in one scene  they all have fake hk mp  sub  machine guns . next scene  ak    replicas  and then  to top it all off  they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of m    s   i think they had a budget shortage for guns  not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys . fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell . you have to remove the pin  spoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own . you can  t fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter . weapons that you throw away don  t suddenly re  appear . when a gun is out of bullets  throwing it away is still pretty stupid . unless you have no idea how to reload them . . big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes . i really cant believe movies like this are actually produced . this movie would be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk .
