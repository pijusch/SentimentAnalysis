the storyline was okay . akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie . kareena kapoor looked bad . there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner . i don  t know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role . there was nothing much to do for him in the movie . just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is . said ali khan was alright . i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot . what are we  fools     what do they think  they will show  men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them . is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals . . . . they take an entire squad of     policemen and no one was there to surround the palace . the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action . akshay kumar was between a circle of      policemen all shooting at him . . . . . and he shooting back at them . none of the policemen  s bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen . crap . crap .  br    br   i think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement .  br    br   i strongly recommend not to see this movie .
