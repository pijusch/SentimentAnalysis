this film proves that the  commercial  cinema  or else  the hollywood movies are in a serious crisis . there is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on shaquille  s name . there is no worth referring to the plot it is a bit more perplexed than a knot . what else  the screen is somewhat dim  o  neal is a bad actor but francis capra is even worse .  br    br   rating     .
