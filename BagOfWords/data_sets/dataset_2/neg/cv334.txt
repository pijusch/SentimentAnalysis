i  m a fan of arty movies  but regretfully i have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel . agonisingly slow to develop a non  existent plot based on a promising premise  the experience is  shall we say  trying . even after bad movies i feel that i learn something  or enjoyed some aspect  but there there was nothing to appreciate . the premise was not uninteresting  but the movie starts and ends there . the acting was ok  though the characters were utterly boring . for the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal  she is mightily empty . pity . i usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic  but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content .
