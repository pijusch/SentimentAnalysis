with the exception of family  this new season is worse than season one . i can  t imagine what they are thinking . as a fan of horror  can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem  but this series gets worse with each outing . i can  t imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day  toiling to churn out such crap . story  is that too much to ask for  character  how can we give damn about the fate of anyone in these stories  if we are not engaged  who cares if they get carved up or whatever  almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting  going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or reason why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting . even dante  s effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion . ironically  the production values and performances tend to be up to speed  while the content is utter crap . i have great hopes for exec producer  s garris  s valarie under the stairs  but we shall see .
