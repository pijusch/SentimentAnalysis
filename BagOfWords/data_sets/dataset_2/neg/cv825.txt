this film is really bad  with a script full of  memorable  lines and incredibly bad performances . the special effects are also bad  not the worst ones i have seen  either  and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it . just two short themes    seconds long or so  are repeated constantly throughout the whole film .  br    br   all in all  one of the worst films i have ever seen .
