come on  let  s get real . the knights of christ  ordo templi  or the knights templar as they are more commonly called did not even exist until the early   th century . the story is so laughable that it  s pathetic . dolph lundgren just looked positively bored . and besides  if you wanted to have a real  life templar  why not just use the knights of christ  who are still in existence in portugal . at least they should have taken history into account . the only redeeming quality i could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or gothic period pieces . the acting was bad  the storyline appalling  the action horrible  and the props were okay .
