i gave this  stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned . from the domestic violence  to sexuality and many of the taboos therein . outside of the gore i really would not call this horror so much as i would science fiction .  br    br   it  s bleak  depressing and hopeless . while i don  t mind a less than cheery ending  i  m really very tired of the  humans suck  clich that  s central to every movie . i know you can  t get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self  hatred as a member of the human race  but how  s  bout as a writer  director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the aliens killing the human race are evil  right now  if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die  just go out  find a lake and swim  til your arms are tired . this way you won  t be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me i deserve to die for being alive . it  s silly  not thoughtful  and boring .
