i should have known i was in trouble with casper van diem as the lead character . words cannot describe  nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was . but please allow me to try to describe it horrible acting  terrible dialog  corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force  fed the beliefs and propeganda from the trinity broadcasting network . its a weak attempt at trying to show hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep  religious message attached to it . they failed miserably . it was clearly the worst movie i have seen in a long time .
