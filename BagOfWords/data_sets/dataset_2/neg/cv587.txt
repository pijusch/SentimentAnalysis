  st watched            out of    dir  walter lang   disappointing musical from a character development standpoint  in my opinion  from this much  heralded rodgers and hammerstein piece . there a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal  at times  of the king of siam by yul brynner   but the movie doesn  t really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings . i can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we don  t fully understand the character  s and their situations . i know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing  but even this part didn  t stand out a lot for me . the basic storyline is about an english woman coming to siam to teach the children about upscale european things . we find out later that the king is actually the biggest pupil . there is a side forbidden romance between the king  s newest wife  played by rita moreno  a latino as an arab   come on    and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though . deborah kerr  as the main female character annie   is ok but not that convincing either . the king learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as he does . this is really a miniscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really .
