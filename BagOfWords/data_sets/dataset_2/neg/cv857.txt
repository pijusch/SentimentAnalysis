the saddest part of this is the fact that these are   minutes i  ll never get back . i knew this was terrible from the get  go  with the guy dressed as a lunatic indian chief on top of the roof .  see if they could get away with that in      . my    year  old boy is really into baseball right now  so we decided to rent it on a rainy day . even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it  i had to cringe when i heard all the needless foul language . bad  bad movie . this was an awful ripoff of bad news bears . completely shameless and completely predictable . i don  t mind a predictable movie if it  s done well  but this one absolutely was not .
