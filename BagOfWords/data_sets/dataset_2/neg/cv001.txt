airport    starts as a brand new luxury    plane is loaded up with valuable paintings  such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens  james stewart  who is flying them  a bunch of vip  s to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum  also on board is stevens daughter julie  kathleen quinlan   her son . the luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid  air the plane is hi  jacked by the co  pilot chambers  robert foxworth   his two accomplice  s banker  monte markham   wilson  michael pataki  who knock the passengers  crew out with sleeping gas  they plan to steal the valuable cargo  land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent chambers almost hits an oil rig in the ocean  loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the bermuda triangle . with air in short supply  water leaking in  having flown over    miles off course the problems mount for the survivor  s as they await help with time fast running out . . .  br    br   also known under the slightly different tile airport     this second sequel to the smash  hit disaster thriller airport       was directed by jerry jameson  while once again like it  s predecessors i can  t say airport    is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons . out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best  just . it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid  air hi  jacking  then the crashing  didn  t he see the oil rig    sinking of the     maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure         submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside  either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the    floods or if any of the doors are opened  it  s a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character  s  dull dialogue  lethargic set  pieces  a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity . while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for    odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks  there  s not as much urgency as i thought there should have been . even when the navy become involved things don  t pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships  helicopters flying about but there  s just something lacking here . george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes  barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background .  br    br   the home video  theatrical version of airport    run    minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence  many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni  flashbacks to flesh out character  s  longer rescue scenes  the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator . while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport    . as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions  interior design choices  i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects aren  t great either . along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie award  s hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that  s a little harsh . the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately  the pace is slow  not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly .  br    br   the production values are alright if nothing spectacular . the acting isn  t great  two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this  one time oscar winner james stewart looks old  frail  also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do  there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too .  br    br   airport    is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far  i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly  the production  bland direction doesn  t help though  a film about a sunken plane just shouldn  t be this boring or lethargic . followed by the concorde . . . airport          .
