dolph lundgren stars as a templar who comes to new york when a key that unlocks the anti  christ is found by an archaeologist  of course the demon is only a couple miles behind dolph and isn  t killed so easily as he transfers from body to body .  like fallen without the suspense  of course lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable . i admit to being a fan of dolph lundgren  like steven seagal and jean  claude van damme  i try to watch his movies whenever they  re on tv . i caught the minion and boy was i ever disappointed . this movie is utterly terrible . with action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena . worst of all is lundgren  s woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest    all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of fallen  which was good  and end of days  which was bad but better than this  overall this movie is the worst movie i  ve seen from dolph lundgren . it literally has nothing to recommend it . it  s awful and it  s the lowest point in lundgren  s career . and i saw cover  up  the last warrior and masters of the universe .  br    br       out of    awful
