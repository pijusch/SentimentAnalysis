the golden era of disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the   s . this show quack pack shouldn  t even be considered a ducktales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with ducktales . it  s about a teen  aged huey  dewey and louie as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hip  hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in ducktales . i prefer the little adventurous nephews from ducktales . there are humans in duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in duckburg . there  s no references of scrooge mcduck . the stories are repetitive  the plot is boring but the animation is good . if you want lots of slapstick humor  i recommend this to you . if you want a better disney show watch  darkwing duck  or  ducktales  .
