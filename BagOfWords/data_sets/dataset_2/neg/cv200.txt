this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise . i live in minnesota and even i can  t believe they dumped cleveland .  yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good  and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league  but still be consistent .  anyway i loved the first major league  liked the second  and always looked forward to the third  when the indians would finally go all the way to the series . you can  t tell me this wasn  t the plan after the second film was completed . what happened  anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don  t watch this junk .
