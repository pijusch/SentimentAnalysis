seriously crappy movie .  br    br   first off  the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse  furniture store . the  bad  cop takes a girl  which they had pulled over  into the warehouse  s attic  while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there . the  bad  cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag  and the newbie cop doesn  t think there are any problems  but he still wonders what was in the bag  so he asks  gets a bullshit response  and then he thinks everything is ok  for now  .  br    br   the  bad  cop repeats this process  and even once with a tit scene  made it slightly better  . but eventually people start to catch on  which took awhile considering how fing obvious it was . one girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies  like ya do . now  the  bad  cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch  and then he gets rid of the duffel  bagged body .  br    br   since she had the oogey  boogey magic put on her  she comes back with lots of eye  shadow on  which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie . . . also  the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become  eye  shadow monsters  . some of the girls meet up with a dude  who is apparently a currency specialist  and he offers them a ride  they look normal to him apparently  . but when the girls see other people  such as the one girls husband  he freaks out because she is hideous  some people freak out  but others don  t even notice  . . . . massive plot hole .  br    br   so  to wrap it up  the eye  shadow monsters kill the  bad  cop  who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene . it was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel  like anyone would want to see part  of this cow dropping .
