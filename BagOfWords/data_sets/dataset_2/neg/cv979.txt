this movie is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen . from the very first scene  i knew it would be a smash crash . it starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission . as it turns out  the people in it were possessed by some random zombies . well  some years later  some college kids are pulling some pledge prank . horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock . things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non  chalonte manner  with pledge over reacting and over  doing the whole  eager to be popular role  what really took the cake with this one is the final battle . absolutely horrible special effects with the guns . for example  guns making a noise with no muzzle flash  and vice  versa . this is accompanied by stop  animation zombies  why they move in stop motion is a mystery   cheesy music  and about   guns that come out of nowhere .  br    br   overall  this movie is crap . just like so many others you can rent for   cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place .
