i only watched the first   minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap . the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie . no  it was a hundred times worse . ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that  s not true the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director ever .  br    br   the american cop has a german accent  the  police station  was a desk in a warehouse with a sign  police station  hanging on the wall . there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feet .  br    br   this cop pulls women over  cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse . he tells his cop partner to wait in the car . then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag . the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right  that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women  but he isn  t sure if that is what  s happening because  he  s a moron  the dialog is totally stupid  the acting is awful  and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen . it is totally obvious to the cop  s partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it  and yet  the partner  who is there all along  doesn  t know what is happening   br    br   the director of this film is a total hack . i stopped the movie at   minutes because i couldn  t take it anymore . it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i won  t waste anymore time on it writing this review .  br    br   absolutely worthless .
