i  m a christian . i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians  however . as a rule  they are  know  nothings  when it comes to movie production . i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen . however  they did a hideous job of it . the acting was horrible  and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion  one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across . not only was the movie terribly made  but the people who made it even had some facts wrong . however  in this  critique   those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into . in short  the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen  and i would not recommend it to anyone  except for comic relief from the every day grind .
