  st watched           out of    dir  brad sykes   mindless   d movie about flesh  eating zombies in a  story within a movie chronicle . and yes  we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in  d   wow  not   that has been done time and time again in  d in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh  eating . that  s what made the original zombie classics good . the flesh  eating was just thrown in as an extra . we  re actually bored throughout most of this   part chronicle because of the lame  twilight  zone like  easily understood and slow  pacingly revealed finale  s . the last story is actually the story the movie started with  having a reporter investigating a so  called ghost town  and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie  s in that one as well . well  i think i  ve said enough . watch the classics  not this  d bore  feast .
