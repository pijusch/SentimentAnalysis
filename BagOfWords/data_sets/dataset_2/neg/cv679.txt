terrible acting by potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever . and as for the feminist polemic  it  s laughable . i saw this garbage when it was first released and though i found it tedious beyond belief i  m glad i did go to see it . that  s because i now have an immediate answer to the question  what  s the worst film you  ve ever seen   plus  i have the comfort of knowing that every film i see for the rest of my life will be better than the tango lesson . but i have to admit i was impressed with the way potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world  as is revealed in the closing credits  .  br    br   i only very recently saw orlando and i can see how potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film . all it took was a bunch of frilly costumes  a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady  and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public . so why shouldn  t she think she could get away with the self  indulgent nothingness that is the tango lesson
