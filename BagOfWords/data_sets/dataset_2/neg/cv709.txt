thoughtless  ignorant  ill  conceived  career  killing  where is the talented angela jones now    deeply unfunny garbage . it  s no wonder reb braddock hasn  t directed anything else since  anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules  based on his own script  with the help of quentin tarantino himself  and creates something like this  anyone who feels that this was a story worth telling to the world  doesn  t deserve a second break . under the circumstances  the performances are good  the actors do what they  re told to do  and they do it well . it  s just that they shouldn  t have done it in the first place .  br    br    out of  .
