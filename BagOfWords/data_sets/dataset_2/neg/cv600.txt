patrick channing  jeff kober  is a disciple of satan  serial killer who possesses the  first power   even after being captured by detective russell logan  lou diamond phillips  and executed in the gas chamber  he is able to move his spirit from body to body and continue to murder at will . with the help of attractive psychic tess seaton  tracy griffith  melanie g .  s half  sister  he attempts to stop channing .  br    br   this concept probably had some possibilities  i think  but ultimately  the first power  suffers from routine scripting and film  making . this is nothing we haven  t seen before  sometimes done better . there is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers . more to the point  it  s not very thrilling and it certainly isn  t scary . phillips is a hard sell as a tough  as  nails  cynical cop stereotype  and griffith doesn  t seem to be trying very hard best cast member is probably the distinctively featured kober  doing his best to be supremely creepy .  br    br   the climax is rather silly and the ending very weak .  br    br   not really even acceptable enough to rate as an average film of its kind  therefore  br    br
