well  here we have yet another role reversal movie . there were many worth watching  despite the tired plot of gender reversal . however  this one is not . in previous reviews  i think i  ve made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for haim movies that followed the late   s . this is one of them .  br    br    just one of the girls  is about a high school kid  corey haim  who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school . he joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader  marie  nicole eggert  . obviously  he can  t keep up the charade for too much longer .  br    br   i thought this movie was utter crap  and it wasn  t even funny . but  judging by a majority of reviews  it looks like fans of alanis morrisette or teen sex queen  nicole eggert  are the only ones who  d want to watch this . if you  re looking for a good haim feature  or role switching comedy   look no further than     . this is about the point that haim  s career tanked .
