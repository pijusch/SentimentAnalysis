camp blood iii is a vast improvement on camp blood ii as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot . this time they  ve ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wilderness .  br    br   this time around there  s a reality tv show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants . this is hardly a new idea  i  ve seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knife .  br    br   unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs . i liked how there  s a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantom .  br    br   i don  t know why anyone would want to make a third camp blood film  i would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one . the half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me  it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for   just like they did in the second movie . they still haven  t worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well  it  s a camp blood movie what do you expect  if you like crap films you  ll get some fun out of this one .
