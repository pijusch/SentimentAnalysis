why did i waste my money on this on the last day of sundance  i want a refund . . . can i have my    back  while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen  nothing did happen . the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot  which was not really like the film . why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out  it was not very artistic . why did the director show lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes  why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading  or was that the point  i felt like phantom love had no story at all  and to be honest i felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film .
