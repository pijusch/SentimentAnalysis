  br    br   i recently viewed this atrocity in my film program  and i thought it was awful  as i said in my tagline  it was pretentious  trite  petty and phenomenally self  important .  br    br   i consider myself a fan of film  and all the things that film has to offer . if i want to watch a documentary on the cannes festival  i will watch ae . . . . and they would probably be alot more objective about it .  br    br   i dont recommend it  period .  br    br
