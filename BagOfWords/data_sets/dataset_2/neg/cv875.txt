if you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of alt    oklar  as it is promised by the tag line  you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of alt    oklar regarding most famous issues like sex  marriage and cheating . to much nudity  which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that alt    oklar was unsuccessfully to  try something new  as he has quoted . to much sex centered jokes seems to show that alt    oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is  sex sells .  i was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique . however in the end i found myself sitting down for   minutes and watching alt    oklar  s experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work .
