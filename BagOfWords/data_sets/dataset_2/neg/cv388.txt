after the success of scooby  doo  where are you  they decided to give scooby and shaggy their own show . but unfortunately  they added a new character that spoilt scooby  doo success forever . they invented a new show with a new title  scooby and scrappy  doo . it was scrappy  doo that made this show a complete failure  probably for both adults and kids together . scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up . scooby and shaggy were getting scared of the villain  and they were also trying to stop him . scooby  doo doesn  t need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews . if they wanted scooby  doo to be more successful  they should have either killed or never thought up scrappy . this was just poor  maybe your kids will prefer it
