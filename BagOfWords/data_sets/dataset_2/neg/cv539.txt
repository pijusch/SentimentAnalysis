my main comment on this movie is how zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie  impressive cast  even for the supporting characters  none of which helps this movie really . i have to admit though  tom hank  s cameo almost made it worth it  what was that about tom  did you lose a bet  the best cameo of the movie was joe isuzu though  by far a classic  the premise is good . basinger  s character  struggling with existence as a pink lady  is making her way toward vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales . this happens as corbett  s character is on his way to vegas to deliver an elvis suit to his soon to be ex  wife motivated by . what else . extortion . as they both make their way  they have numerous run  ins with elvis impersonators who on their way to an elvis impersonating convention in vegas . soon  the fbi gets involved and begins to track what they think is an elvis impersonator serial killer . unfortunately  premise doesn  t mean the movie was good .  br    br   when watching this movie  imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity aren  t really important . it is much more enjoyable to just watch basinger look beautiful in her pink lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn  t really make sense . the movie tries hard  but ultimately falls way way way short . ultimately  it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny .  br    br   it isn  t the worst  but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one don  t say i didn  t warn you
