a lot of other reviewers here  including many whose opinions i respect  hold this slice of european sleaze horror in high regard . personally  i didn  t like it at all . its an incoherent attempt at a atmospheric period cross between sex and violence . jess franco at his best makes these kinds of films very well . unfortunately  the infamous exploitation filmmaker joe d  amato does not . d  amato  s most well known films are infamous for their high gross  out quotient . this  an early film by him  doesn  t have the constant disgusting scenes that his more notorious  anthropophagous  and  beyond the darkness  did . ultimately  its an incoherent film that doesn  t manage to involve the viewer in any way . without the sleaze factor either  it becomes very boring . as i said  others have enjoyed this film  but i just found it to be a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing .  br    br   there are a few pluses for the film . ewa aulin  from  candy   is in it  and she looks pretty hot and is often naked . however  cult film icon klaus kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main film . he seems bored with the role and doesn  t have the manic intensity he does at his finest . the music score is nice and there are some brief moments of unintentionally funny gore . still  this is a pretentious and pointless film that manages to be incredibly boring .
