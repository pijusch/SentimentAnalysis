i have never read the book  a wrinkle in time  . to be perfectly honesty  after seeing the movie  do i really want to  well  i shouldn  t be reviewing this movie i  ll start off with that . next i  ll say that the tv movie is pretty forgettable . do you know why i say that  because i forgot what happens in it . i told you it was forgettable . to be perfectly honest  no tv movie will ever be better than  merlin  .  br    br   how do i describe a tv movie  i have never written a review for one before . well  i  ll just say that they usually have some celebrities . a wrinkle in time includes only one . alfre woodard  or woodward  i am not sure   the oscar winner .  br    br   the film has cheesy special effects  a mildly interesting plot  scenes that make you go  wtf  . the movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go  wtf  . what did i expect  it  s a tv movie . they usually aren  t good . as is this one . a wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster . to top it off  you  ll most likely forget about it the second it  s over . well  maybe not the second it  s over . but within a few minutes .  br    br   a wrinkle in time
