i saw this film yesterday . . i rented the dvd from blockbuster . . in fact  i know one of the actresses from the film . . i won  t say who . .   that  s kept under wraps . .  but i must admit  it wasn  t as good as i thought it would be . . tom savini  hats down to this guy . . but it  s a shame he wasn  t in the film for long . . what lacks the film is the idea  the script  sound  etc . . it may look like a good movie . . but it wasn  t that entertaining . .  br    br   well  i  m glad my sister paid    for renting  dvd  s from blockbuster . . i chose this one . . and i was disappointed . anyway  thumbs down for me . .  not my cup of tea   out of
