normally  i have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but i was so disappointed with this movie that i spent an hour registering with imdb just to get it off my chest .  br    br   you would think a movie with names like morgan freeman or kevin spacey would be a bankable bet . . . well  this movie was just terrible . it is nigh on impossible to  suspend disbelief   i tried  really  i wanted to enjoy it but justin timberlake just wouldn  t let me .  br    br   timberlake should stick to music  what a dreadful performance  no presence as an actor  no character . can  t blame everything on justin the movie also boast a dreadful plot  badly timed editing its definitely an  f  .  br    br   after seeing this  i have to wonder what really motivates actors . i mean  surely morgan actually read the script before taking the part . did he not see how poor it was  what then could motivate him to take the part  money  of course  acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work .  br    br   ll cool j is a great actor he gets a lot more screen time than freeman or spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script .  br    br   meanwhile  the audience goes  what the hell is going on here  you expect me to believe this crap    br    br   in short  apart from justin a great lineup badly executed  very disappointing .
