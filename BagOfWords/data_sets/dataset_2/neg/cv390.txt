this movie barely followed the story line of the movie . all of the fascinating points in the book didn  t even exist in the movie . they ended up turning it into a cheesy  tween  disney movie  crush  story between meg and calvin . it was so bad it should have been hillary duff playing the part  or one of the likes . this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book . i can  t believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap  basic rendition . if you  ve ever read the book  i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of  lord of the rings  equivalence . this movie should have never been able to use the title of a wrinkle in time . poorly done .
