as if the storyline wasn  t depressing enough  this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher . weird stuff . then there  s the core premise of the hero  heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a he  s besot  ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl . is this person a psycho  a masochist  just a doomed queen who takes things too far  and what sort of traumatic childhood did he have  just that he didn  t get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly . he tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did  but it  s really really so hard to empathize . such sad and unusual self destruction . was it supposed to be funny  what was it all about really
