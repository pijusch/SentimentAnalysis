an expedition led by hunky captain storm  mark dana  travels to the valley of the kings in cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition . they meet beautiful mysterious simira  ziva rodann  who joins them . they soon find themselves faced with a blood drinking mummy . . . and only simira seems to know what  s going on .  br    br   a real snoozer . i caught this on late night tv when i was about   . it put me to sleep  seeing it again all these years later i can see why . it  s slow  moving  the mummy doesn  t even show up until   minutes in  and this is only   minutes long    the acting ranges from bad  dana  to real bad  george n . neise  and there  s no violence or blood to be found . this movie concentrates more on second rate dramatics  involving a silly love triangle  than horror .  br    br   this rates three stars because it actually looks pretty good  everyone plays it straight  there  s some good acting from diane brewster  it  s short and the mummy attack scenes  all three of them  aren  t bad . they  re not scary just mildly creepy . still  this movie is pretty bad . a sure fire cure for insomnia .
