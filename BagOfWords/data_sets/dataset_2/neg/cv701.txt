the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo    and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day .  br    br   this would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the  whole earth  picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window .  br    br   i am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa  though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map  and the ones in private hands would still be a problem .  br    br   ah  a response  trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data i  d say is a charming  but weak and gullible argument . what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie  a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels . do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here     this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by u . s . government that the moon  missions were a success  and that man now are true masters of the universe . things are nearly never quite what they seem . . just watch the movie  and i dear say you  ll see things a bit different than before .   br    br   first off  weather data doesn  t come from nasa  it comes for met agencies around the world . second  the weather data undermines a major claim in the film . third  far from being  packed with irrefutable evidence   the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked . sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film  so he edited it and added his own interpretation . unfortunately for him  his source film is public domain  and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims .
