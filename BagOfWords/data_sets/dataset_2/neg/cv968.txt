here  s an indie film i really wanted to like  but ultimately could not . the lack of script  boldly proclaimed in the main titles  really shows through and kills the picture . the story is a nonsensical mess that isn  t worth trying to figure out . i quickly became bored within   minutes  then suffered through the remainder of the first   minutes   hoping for the best   before hitting the chapter stops to  mercifully  get to the end . . . even that wasn  t worth the extra effort . ozark savage clearly tries too hard to be clever  lifting its best sequences from evil dead  and the matrix . as a result  there  s very little in ozark savage that hasn  t been done before  and better . this film would have been much more fun as a      minute short  but as a feature  it just feels padded and forced . of course  there  s no money in shorts  so i completely understand the financial reasons that i assume motivated it being stretched out to    minutes . director matt steinauer shows great promise  and i wish him luck .
