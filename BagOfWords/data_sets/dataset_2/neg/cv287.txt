i saw this movie in the theater when i was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial . the commercial was great  but it i found out later that it had every explosion or  special effect  in the entire movie  about   and even some that weren  t in the movie . there was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as i remember . it was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people . i guess my world of innocence ended that day  when i found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies .
