my guess is that this director  writer had something to say . let  s see  what it could have been . . . a . frog storms would be creepy  b . can i get someone like tom cruise to say the  c  word many times and look like a bad patrick rafter  c . cast my wife and get her to say the  f  word every  seconds . this aside i really liked the beginning and the frog storm . the rest was a relentless  over  long  under  edited   over  indulgent failure . glad so many of you enjoyed it   br    br
