there is no suspense in this serial  when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy  the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day . no  in fact  the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode  this show is so boring that i can  t see how it ever got made  let alone released on dvd  obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary batman films  but even the script is awful . an incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that  i am not quite sure  because it is too awful to follow . watch the   s version  or the    s versions  or even batman begins  just anything over this version
