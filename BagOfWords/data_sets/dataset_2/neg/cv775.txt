yes  i sat through the whole thing  god knows why .  br    br   it was a long afternoon  i had nothing to do  it was bitterly cold outside  okay  those are all lame excuses but they  re the only ones i have .  br    br   i gave the darkling  stars out of a possible    i have seen worse films  but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom   poor script  poor acting  bad lighting  and cheesy special effects .  br    br   the storyline  which never completely makes sense  revolves around this simple little family  daddy  mommy  and little girl   that i assume the viewer is supposed to be  identifying  with  all three of them were tedious and annoying . you just want the dark side to get every one of them .  br    br   daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars . daddy meets a rich man named rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the  mysterious  orient . rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as  the darkling  .  br    br   during the course of the film  the darkling is explained as being about  or  different things a shadow without a person  the inner darkness that exists in all of us  and the devil . so take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy   because trust me  it doesn  t really matter .  br    br   the darkling  s main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion   it gets a human companion   and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being . this  of course  leads to immense wealth  followed by disaster  for the human who hooks up with the darkling .  br    br   and for the rest of us   it just leads to a very long  tedious movie .  br    br
