what was franco zeffirelli thinking  was hollywood responsible for this travesty  or can i take comfort in the idea that someone who didn  t speak english as a first language just completely missed the point of charlotte bronte  s classic  i don  t think i can improve on a comment i read below  so i  ll just paraphrase it  jane eyre is a great great book  the screenwriter should read it sometime .  it  s true that this movie  s two leads were sadly miscast . but pity the actors  because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes . the dialog that makes you understand the jane and rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun . . . deleted from the script . the marriage proposal  the fortune teller . . . gone . the allusions  half joking  half sincerely felt  to jane as a fairy sprite from olde england come to rescue rochester in his despair . . . eliminated .  br    br   it is unfortunate that zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and jane  s interactions with the rivers family . but it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written .  br    br   do yourself a favor and go find the        mini series with timothy dalton .
