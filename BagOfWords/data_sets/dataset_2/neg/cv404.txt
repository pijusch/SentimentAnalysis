the book is so good that at least the opening of this made  for  tv movie will move you  but then  as it diverges more and more from the book  taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches  it becomes boring . still  from comments i  ve heard  people who have not read the book tend to like it  and if it leads even on child to read a wrinkle in time  it will have served its purpose . the most embarrassing change is to make the happy medium a clone of mary poppins  uncle albert  i love to laugh  . nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny .
