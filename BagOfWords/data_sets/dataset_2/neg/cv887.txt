i feel like i  m the only kid in town who was annoyed by branagh  s performance . he is a fine actor by most accounts  but he simply could not pull off the southern accent . i mean  it was deplorable . it was as if he was trying too hard to be a yank . one of the previous reviewers questioned why u . s . actors were not cast in this film . i second that notion . it  s wonderful when actors  actresses wish to expand their horizons  but it  s another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained . maybe it was altman  but he  s a such a great director . . .  br    br   well  i really don  t want to bash branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much . everybody deserves to screw up here and there . but it is hard to watch something so annoying that you  d rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through the gingerbread man .
