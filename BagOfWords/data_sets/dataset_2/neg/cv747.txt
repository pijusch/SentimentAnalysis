this movie was like a bad indie with a  list talent . the plot was silly  all the way to the end . it reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the      s . i would have given it a one  but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile . i think the worst thing was the underwater scene  s held off of the dock . the underwater lighting seemed to come from no were  and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air  this air tank would kind of appear . i would avoid this  unless there is nothing else on the shelf . good day .
