first lesson that some film makers  particularly those inspired by hollywood  need to know  just  style  does not sell . i guess tashan when translated will mean style . second  if you are hell bent on selling style  that does not spare you from having a decent story .  br    br   tashan has some story which could have sufficed with some better director . but it is not slick . for example  all three  saif  kareena and akshay  are narrators at different points in the story . but this setup is not utilized to properly . there could have been a better mix and match of their narrations . actions sequences are from the seventies .  br    br   cheoreography of the film is awful . i think vaibhavi merchant just sleep walked through this film . vishal  shekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film . why is there a sufi song  dil haara  in tashan  why is the cool hinglish song  dil dance maare  not on anil kapoor when he is the one who is english crazy   br    br   akshay kumar is the saving grace of the film . but he is in his stereotyped self . you won  t mind missing this film .
