this movie was okay  but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are  born that way   especially when a woman can exit out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman . it almost seems as if kate  s gender preferences turned on and off like a switch  making this film seem a little simplistic .  br    br   also  as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda  it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval over the gay lifestyle were labeled as  bigots .  and there was no happy medium . it was either kate  s friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her . this is not typical of interactions between gay and non  gay relatives and friends . it is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play . it is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning the choices they make . sadly  the movie showed none of these types of interactions . for a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance  it struck me as very intolerant movie  then at the end  kate apparently decides after all these years she wants to be with mac and everything is hunky dory  is that what being gay is really all about  come on
