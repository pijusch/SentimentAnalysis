this may have been made for the hell of it  but it was most probably the worst film i  ve seen in years  the best thing about the entire dvd would be the case    i  m surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too  i  m glad i only rented . i suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to care about it without taking in any cgi or any other effects for that matter  i hope alex chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and sfx to make a better film in the future  that is  if he is still in work .  br    br   notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing  don  t buy it
