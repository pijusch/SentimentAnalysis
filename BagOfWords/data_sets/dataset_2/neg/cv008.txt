this film is mediocre at best . angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers . her bitchy demeanor from  law and order  carries over in a failed attempt at comedy . charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti  comedy . the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denise  s marriage . hopefully that effort produces better results .
