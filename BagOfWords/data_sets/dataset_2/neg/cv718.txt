the last tarzan film starring johnny weissmuller  looking surprisingly aged a year after  tarzan and the huntress   is bad  in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better . it is obvious that rko tried to make a great farewell for weissmuller  shooting in beautiful scenery in mxico  with a top star of that country  andrea palma  and multiple award  winning cinematographer gabriel figueroa  and bringing in prestigious composer dimitri tiomkin to do the score . although it may have cost less for filming abroad  it looks more expensive than any other rko film in the series  taking advantage of acapulco beaches and real pyramids as aquatania  and with impressive dcors for all the scenes related to the temple of god balu  especially the exterior  built on steep rocks .  kurt neumann should have stayed as director  instead of robert florey  who gives it a very slow pace . neumann had done a fine work with  tarzan and the amazons    tarzan and the leopard woman  and  tarzan and the huntress   and finished his career directing the classic  the fly  the year before his death while florey became a television director  after a career of few remarkable films . if weissmuller looks tired  the chimp playing cheeta is not as good as the others  but the worst character is benji  an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs  that have a caribbean air  in a location supposed to be africa and shot in mxico   boring and decidedly of dubious taste  it was a sad farewell to weissmuller  s tarzan .
