ouch  this one was a bit painful to sit through . it has a cute and amusing premise  but it all goes to hell from there . matthew modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying  and he does not disappoint in this one . deborah kara unger and john neville turned in surprisingly decent performances . alan bates and jennifer tilly  among others  played it way over the top . i know that  s the way the parts were written  and it  s hard to blame actors  when the script and director have them do such schlock . if you  re going to have outrageous characters  that  s ok  but you gotta have good material to make it work . it didn  t here . run away screaming from this movie if at all possible .
