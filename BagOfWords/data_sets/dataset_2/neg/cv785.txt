where to start  this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen . the editing is the worst ever  the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was whacked . most of the movie all one could here is the crappy kicking effects  with muddled talking in the background . i had to turn my volume on full blast just to her what was going on . . . . and what was i supposed to hear exactly  probably one of the worst scripts ever made . i can  t believe people actually put up some green for this film . it makes me think i could take a crap in a box  send it to producers  and then have them finance a movie for me .  br    br   dolph  was a usual  dolph . nothing else needs to be said . the villains were bad  the protagonists were bad  and the movie was a stinker . if you really want to know what not to do when either writing  directing or editing a movie  watch this
