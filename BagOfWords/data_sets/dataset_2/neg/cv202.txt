okay  just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie . well  at least i did . it started out good but became so boring after the first half hour . spoiler  br    br   it tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants . the only problem is that her daughter  s friend is the girl in the way . she always wins the competitions  therefore pushing the mother further towards  eliminating  her . after talking to a  hitman   the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit . so actions are taken but she eventually gets caught .  br    br   the cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening . don  t waste your time watching this .  br    br
