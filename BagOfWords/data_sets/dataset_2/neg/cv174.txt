slashers . . . . . well if you like horrors its definitely one to see  otherwise don  t even bother . it is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget  for instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere  and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow  trust me you wont need to look for them . also try to ignore the cheesy actors  if thats what you call them   the basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being  killers on the loose and whoever live  s at the end gets rich . now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days  for example when i watched it i thought to my self i would  nt mind having a go at this game  especially for    .    .    . so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind .
