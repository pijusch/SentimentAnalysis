this movie deserves more than a  . but i  m giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a   resulting in it getting a rating that  ll take it into the top    list . seriously it  s not that great its not that bad . its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it  s ridiculous . these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say  i  m rick james b  tch  no matter how old or annoying it gets . i dread having to hear  i  m tired of mfn snakes on this mfn plane  months from now from idiots trying to be funny . its crappy plot crap acting etc . its okay to love a bad movie  but you still gotta admit its a bad movie .  br    br   wait for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie
