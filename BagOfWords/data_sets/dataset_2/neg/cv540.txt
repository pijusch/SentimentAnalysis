omg  the only reason i  m giving this movie a  instead of a  is because tom hanks is funny as an elvis  in  the  box . apart from that  how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie   maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time . . . there are no laughs to mention  the stereotypes are pathetic  the cast is wasted  the direction is amateurish . now that i think about it  most of the blame probably lies with the director  joel zwick . he brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved . don  t waste your time like i did but then  i enjoy a good train wreck . geez  now the system is telling me i need more lines   here ya go this movie should be called return to sender . okay  now that was funnier than anything in the movie . . .
