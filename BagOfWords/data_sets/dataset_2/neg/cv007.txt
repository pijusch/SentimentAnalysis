i don  t know who to blame  the timid writers or the clueless director . it seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars  angie  charlie  denise  rosanna and jon  that there wasn  t enough left to really make a movie . this could have been very entertaining  but there was a veil of timidity  even cowardice  that hung over each scene . since it got an r rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a    year  old woman and not angie harmon  why does sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world  if they were only looking for laughs why not cast whoopi goldberg and judy tenuta instead  this was so predictable i was surprised to find that the director wasn  t a five year old . what a waste  not just for the viewers but for the actors as well .
