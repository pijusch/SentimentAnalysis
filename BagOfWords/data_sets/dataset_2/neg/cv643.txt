i  m sorry  i had high hopes for this movie . unfortunately  it was too long  too thin and too weak to hold my attention . when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream  i felt cheated . surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper  something more meaningful .  br    br   so  don  t buy a large drink or you  ll be running to the rest room . my kids didn  t enjoy it either . ah well .
