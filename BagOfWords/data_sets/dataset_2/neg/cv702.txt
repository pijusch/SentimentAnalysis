there are so many incorrect statements in this so  called  documentary  that i found myself shouting at the television .  br    br   bart sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking dvd  but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims .  br    br   he relies on either being inaccurate  not telling the full story  or the old favourite  government always lies to us  innuendos  and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims .  br    br   what  s more  his  exclusive  or  unreleased  footage is freely available over the internet from various sites .  br    br   further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews  and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinions .  br    br   all of the claims made by mr sibrel about  inaccuracies    mistakes   or  whistleblowing  in the apollo programme have been thoroughly disproven .  br    br   how do i get that    odd minutes of my life back
