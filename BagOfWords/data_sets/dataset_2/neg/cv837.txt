waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand  i expected an interesting sci  fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot  technology  instead i went disappointed by each aspect of it  once more proving that stunning special effects can  t help a boring plot  which by my opinion was the worse in this year . acting in this movie also dissatisfied me  will smith didn  t show anything new in this movie  yet i never saw his acting to change since  men in black  which was his only success by my opinion . he had to retire since than  not spoiling his name with titles like  i  robot  and  men in black   .
