this movie had some great actors in it  unfortunately they had forgotten how to act . i was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start . it actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time . maybe it was the musical score or the director himself  but one thing is for sure the make  up artist needs to get another job  the facial powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces  would not recommend this movie to anyone  no wonder it never hit the theaters . cuba gooding jr .  james woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all . the plot was great just needed a whole lot more .
