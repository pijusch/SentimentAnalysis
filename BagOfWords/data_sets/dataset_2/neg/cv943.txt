i rented this dvd for two reasons . a cast of great actors  and the director  even though robert altman can be hit or miss . in this case  it was a big miss . altman  s attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester . after seeing kenneth branagh in a good film like  dead again   i didn  t think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey  and i hope it didn  t ruin his reputation . robert duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one  time oscar winners . on a downward spiral that includes acting in eating  money films such as this one . duvall was once a great actor in excellent films  even though his best performance was not  tender mercies   but  the great santini  . this movie was truly a big waste of time . i give it a  out of   .
