except for acknowledging some nice cinematography  i can hardly say anything positive about this movie . the single real issue is the protagonist  s dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life . abundant  emotionally powerful  scenes do not go with this plot and  because of bad acting  they also fail to create the intended atmosphere . the director only manages to introduce anthony  s dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution . the characters do not seem to evolve  although it is difficult to speak of any characters . . . perhaps except for sonny . beside him  actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to  they come off as self  indulging amateurs . i wonder what ruined the movie more the superficial script  throwing away all the potential of the plot  or the bad acting  disturbing any appeal that might be left .
