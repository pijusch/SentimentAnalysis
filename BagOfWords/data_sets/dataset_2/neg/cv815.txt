i have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie . i guess i must have missed something . the beginning is intriguing  the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories . that  s the best part . after the three go their separate ways  the film splits into three threads . that  s when boredom sets in . certainly  the thread with the felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity . unfortunately  the director beat this one to death  even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular . bottom line a two  hour plot  thin listlessness . if you suffer from insomnia  view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep .
