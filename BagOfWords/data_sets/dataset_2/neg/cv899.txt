how a director of altman  s experience could ever expect us to want to spend time with  or to care about what happens to  a lead character who is neurotic  a whiner  a jerk with no redeeming qualities   that is the central puzzle about this profoundly confused piece of work . a monstrous piece of trash . in addition to this crippling flaw  the plot line requires serious concentration to follow . the setup that the branagh character walks into is so obviously a setup from the start that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience . this latter issue is at the core of the film it represents directorial self  indulgence with profound contempt for the taste  values  and intelligence of the viewer . very unusual for mr . altman .  br    br   patrick watson
