bizarre take on the cinderella tale . terribly poor script  but kathleen turner turns in a pretty decent evil step  mother performance .  br    br   visually stunning in some parts  but that  s about it . the period costumes range from the elizabethan era to the     s . fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full   minutes of drivel .  br    br   if you  re really in the mood for a cinderella story  i suggest  ever after a cinderella story  or  the glass slipper  .
