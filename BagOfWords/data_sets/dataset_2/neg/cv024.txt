the worst movie i have seen since tera jadoo chal gaya . there is no story  no humor  no nothing  the action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard akshay kumar thumbs  up advertisements stitched together . heavily influenced from the matrix and kung  fu hustle but very poorly executed .  br    br   i did not go a lot of expectations  but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder  what were these guys thinking      .  br    br   the only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic kareena in a bikini .  br    br   the reason why i did not give a rating of    is that every time i think i have seen the worst  bollywood proves me wrong .
