unlike many  i don  t find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive . its execution  however  is another matter entirely . like so many b  minus movies  all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers . for most of the    or  so minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor . or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers . with a couple of exceptions the acting is awful the comical over  emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a late  night infomercial  but not a primetime sitcom  even a canadian one .  notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle  i cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the cbc to replicate the success of corner gas . unfortunately  they got the tone   and the script   completely wrong for the prairies . the final insult is that they apparently couldn  t even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town  why  are they so hard to find in saskatchewan   did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown regina exteriors  as a proud canadian i hope this thing goes away soon  and that the rest of the world  primed by the cbc  s publicists  quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom .
