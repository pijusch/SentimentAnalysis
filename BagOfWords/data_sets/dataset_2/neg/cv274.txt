this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen  its horrible . christopher lee is good but he is hardly in it  the only the good part is the opening scene .  br    br   don  t be fooled by the title .  end of the world  is truly a bad movie  i stopped watching it close to the end it was so bad  only for die hard b  movie fans that have the brain to stand this vomit .
