this film is so much of a rip  off of the masterpeice  demons  and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching . the acting is terrible  the action scenes are speeded up  the script is almost painful and budget non existent .  br    br   if you think this film is good then you havn  t seen a real horror film  skip this and get a copy of the movie demons .
