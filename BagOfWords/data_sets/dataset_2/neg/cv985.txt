this film is absolutely horrific . one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen . the story does nearly not exist  the characters are full of stereotypes and the special  fx only make you laugh . the only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the rapper coolio as some kind of police officer .  br    br   if this film was supposed to be a comedy i didn  t quite get the point . if you want to watch this movie please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughs . . . especially when the first special  fx appear on the screen .  br    br   but if you like trash movies made on the cheap this film is a must  see for you .
