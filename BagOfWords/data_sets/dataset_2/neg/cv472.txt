this movie is great  mind you  but only in the way it tells a very bad story . stella is so terribly crude  and never learns better . her husband is incredibly snobby and small  minded . neither ever learns better . is this realistic  somehow  stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners  dress  yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down  i don  t think so . stella is a good woman  and a very good mother . giving up herself  so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting .  br    br   much of what we see might have been normal for the times  people having a beer or two  enjoying a player piano  dancing  but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority .  i can  t have our child living this way   spare me .  br    br   this story tells me one thing that the unwashed working class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the upper classes . and that is simply a load of hogwash .
