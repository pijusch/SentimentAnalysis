i  ll be honest . the only reason i watched this one on tv is that it  s in the imdb bottom    . and right now  i  m wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another  check  on that same list .  br    br   van damme is luc deveraux  who finds himself on a huge fight with the universal soldiers after the main computer pulled a  hal  to defend itself . and yes  after all the obligate explosions  shoot  outs and chases he is the last one standing . combined with terrible acting and a bit of a boring set  up it makes sure it  s place in the infamous list is just .  br    br   only for the idiots like me who want to watch that full list .     .
