this is one of the worst films i  ve ever seen . i looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since i loved the novel  and i wish i hadn  t . i turned it off after a little less than an hour  though i wanted to turn it off after five minutes . i wish i had . it disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors . unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last   or so minutes  which would be impossible  i would in no way recommend this . its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the   th century . i don  t think  as many people say that it is  that  the bell jar  is necessarily unfilmable  but this particular rendition could have been done without . i  d almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice .
