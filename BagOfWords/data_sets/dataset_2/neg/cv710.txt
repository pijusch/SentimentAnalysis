the idea is nice . bringing so many stars in one movie is great . but . . . . too many stories  too short and lacking really any sense . no connection between the scenes . there were some    brilliant stories . . . but these were out of   . the frame reminded me of  all the invisible children   a movie which i liked a lot . compared to it  however   paris je t  aime  lacks the intriguing short story  which develops  starts and has its end . and it lacks the topic connecting all those  children . i do not find paris enough of a topic to connect   short sketches together . perhaps for people who know paris it is interesting . otherwise  i wouldn  t recommend it . . .
