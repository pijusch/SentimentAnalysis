i  m trying to picture the pitch for dark angel .  i  m thinking matrix  i  m thinking bladerunner  i  m thinking that chick that plays faith in angel  wearing shiny black leather  or some chick just like her  leave that one with us . only  get this   we  ll do it without any plot  dialogue  character  decent action or budget  just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike . fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes  right    br    br   flashy  shallow  dreary  formulaic  passionless  tedious  dull  dumb  humourless  desultory  barely competent . live action anime without any action  or indeed any life . sf just the way joe fanboy likes it  in fact .
