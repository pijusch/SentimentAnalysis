this film wasn  t programmed in italian cinemas  i have seen it at a manifestation called  fantafestival  . i find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark  the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and there  s no suspence in the film . music is completely out of the story and i don  t have words to describe the visual effects . if you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting  but a few minutes later it becomes busy . the story is interesting but the development needs a complete review .
