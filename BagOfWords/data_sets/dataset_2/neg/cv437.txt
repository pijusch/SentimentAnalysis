with knightly and o  tool as the leads  this film had good possibilities  and with mccallum as the bad guy after knightly  maybe some tension . but they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants . it was of course totally superficial  beautiful english country and seaside or not . the number one mistake was dumping knightly so early on in the film  when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older  instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part . they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast  and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low  cost heartstring elements .
