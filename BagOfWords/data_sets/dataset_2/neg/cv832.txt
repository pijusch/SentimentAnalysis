i should never have started this film  and stopped watching after     s . i missed the really botched ending . this film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better . it had nice atmosphere  a top notch cast and director  good locations . but a baaaaaad story line  a bad script . i paid attention to kenneth branagh  s southern accent   it was better than the script . the plot was stupid   driven by characters acting in unreal and improbable ways . no one behaves like this outside of hollywood scripts .
