a horribly pointless and  worse  boring film . stranger than fiction has nothing new to say about anything  no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes  and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way .  br    br   will ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to jim carey  s truman show  and substitutes his usual shouting routine  admittedly very funny if you discount talledega nights  for  well  pretty much nothing .  br    br   emma thompson is no more than mildly irritating  that some reviews i  ve read here are talking her up for an oscar nomination is laughable  whilst maggie gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy . please . that she ended up falling for ferrell  s  character  is utterly ludicrous .  br    br   marc forster  s attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work with .  br    br   i had the choice of either going to watch the prestige for the third time or seeing this . i wish i  d opted for the prestige .
