mst     should do this movie . it is the worst acted movie i have ever seen . first of all  you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in     and pays his rent in cash . there is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allowed to be that close to a president not to mention a high profile job . also  the head of security for the pothus would not be so emotional that he would start drinking into a haze if the president was shot . this movie sucked . i cannot express the extremite that this movie was . every single actor was terrible . even the chick at the trailer park . i crap on this garbage . what a waste of time .
