i saw this film at a pre  release screening at the writers guild theater in beverly hills . as i recall  the film  s producers and director were in attendance  presumably to gage our reaction .  br    br   many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience  which would have been fine if it had been a comedy  but it was supposed to be a horror film .  br    br   if the audience wasn  t scared  it seems the filmmakers were . they delayed release for over a year . out of curiosity i saw it again to see if they  d re  cut it as far as i can tell  they hadn  t . it was the same lousy movie  just a year older .  br    br   it almost qualifies as  so bad  it  s good   but it  s slow  paced and boring .
