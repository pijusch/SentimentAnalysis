what a stinkeroo this turned out to be    at one time  much earlier in her career  linda darnell was one of my favorites  no great shakes as an actress  but very beautiful and pleasant  particularly in films like  the mark of zorro  and  blood and sand   but when i saw this monstrosity  the memories of her golden days faded quickly . the story is unbelievable and farcical  the acting second  rate  the supporting cast insufferable . i cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to tab hunter  and donald gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked . added to this  was the terrible photography  and i am not just referring to the color   everyone associated with this  must have shuddered whenever it was shown .
