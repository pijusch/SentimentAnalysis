this  the direct  to  video death rattle of the tremors series  features sixty inspired seconds  sawblade you  ll know it when you see it  and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at . tremors  was obviously shot on a cripplingly low budget . that means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of precious worm  on  human violence  tops . the lackluster  cliche  spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the tremors  experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long . only hardcore tremors fans will be able to sit through  much less enjoy this film . if you aren  t among them  don  t bother .
