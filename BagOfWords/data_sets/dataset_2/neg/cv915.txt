this version is pretty insipid  i  m afraid . jane eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood  but william hurt  s weary  throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of edward rochester and poor charlotte gainsbrough looks like a bored  petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt  i also can  t believe that they eliminated edward  s great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book  one of the most moving moments in literature . i do appreciate that they finally used such a young  plain woman to play jane  a character who is supposed to be a worldly    but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel  please see the    s version with george c . scott and susannah york . york was too old  tall and pretty to play jane  but no one has touched rochester  s character the way that scott did .
