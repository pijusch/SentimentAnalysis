   minutes  and it felt twice that long  brief crossing is not brief enough . indeed  the first   minutes or so consist almost entirely of a dialogue  more of a monologue  really  of a woman approaching middle age  tediously droning about  men   disappointment  sex  aging  and her recent breakup  to a french teenager she met in the ship  s cafeteria .  br    br   the tedious monologue continues as they go to duty  free shop  and to a bar  where finally her self  involved rant pushes him away . the  story  can  t end there  of course  so she persuades him to listen to her drone on more as she brings him to her cabin .  br    br   what little romance  sex  or for that matter  anything at all this film has besides bitter rantings is hardly enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens at all . yes  the ending is very nicely done  but it is scant reward to subject yourself to what amounts to a turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner .  br    br   of course  some people like it . i could be wrong .
