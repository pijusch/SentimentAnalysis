this is a good example of how not to make a film .  br    br   there is very little meaningful dialog  no context for the events  and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes . the result is a confused  clueless viewer the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director  s commentary .  br    br   this movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is  with an emphasis on child abuse . it includes some stock footage of real  horrible acts of violence  including war time executions . although it works in the context of the movie  i feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content . this film is absolutely not for the weak stomached or the easily offended  and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors .  br    br   the climax is anti  climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie . if you  re not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it .  br    br   the director  s commentary was a one  shot   sit the guy down and let him talk  no cuts  type of commentary . while this isn  t necessarily bad  the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college  filming conditions  co producers  bad film  and a dozen other things . the constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie .  br    br   the movie was shot many years ago on   mm and super  film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget . because of this  the video and audio quality is poor . that alone does not make it a bad movie  but it does make a bad movie worse .
