  don  t bother to watch this film  would be better advice  if you like marilyn monroe in her other roles . this was a huge disappointment considering the great cast  not just marilyn .  br    br   the story was just nothing  certainly nothing like described on the vhs box  of course . there simply was no suspense  precious little excitement and too many dull spots  most of them trying to show why  nellie   monroe  was so messed up . this was not a good role for monroe  even though i didn  t need to see this character to know she could act .  some like it hot  alone was good enough evidence for me . but this role just didn  t fit her and it  s no surprise it wasn  t one of her more popular films .  br    br   it  s also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like richard widmark  anne bancroft  elisha cook jr .  jeanne cagney  donna cocoran and others .  br    br   summary it  s not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game .
