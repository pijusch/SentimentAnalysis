spoilers contained  br    br   i  d heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific . what i didn  t expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go . what starts off as a typical cowboy  indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic  comedy  about honus  soldier blue of the title played by peter strauss  and cresta  candice bergen  who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the cheyenne . the majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit . donald pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason . they then escape and both turn up  separately  at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the cheyenne base . as cresta used to be married to one of the cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them . so far so ordinary . then comes the ending . after enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they  won  t they get together storyline  the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head . similarities can be drawn with the wild bunch at this point of the film but the wild bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn  t resort to extreme gratuitous violence . in some ways  soldier blue reminds me of frank perry  s last summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending . i didn  t hate soldier blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending . if you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents  i would recommend elem klimov  s come and see .
