raising victor vargas is just a bad film . no amount of denial or ad  dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact .  br    br   maybe peter sollett saw he didn  t have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current  edgy film  making  . maybe he just doesn  t know any better . it  s hard to tell .  br    br   what  s not hard to tell is the result . except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film  making into an attempt at pseudo  realism  few will enjoy it .  br    br   i know i didn  t .  br    br   do yourselves a favor and pass on this film .
