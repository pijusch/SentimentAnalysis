i found tremors  the legend begins  to be dull and boring . all the action scenes were stupid . the so called  graboids  are reduced to the size of a modern day house cat  if not smaller . the acting was horrendous  and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the tremor saga  because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed  the story is so dumb and useless . also  if you want to tell a story way back in time  make sure you use the same actor  michael gross   to be someone in the past  when he  s someone in the present in the other tremor movies . geez . . . if you haven  t seen this film  don  t waste your time . stick to tremors      and   for a good time . this film however  make sure you  re remote is sitting right next to you with the stop button working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense .
