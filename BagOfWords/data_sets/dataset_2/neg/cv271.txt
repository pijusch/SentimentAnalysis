i work as a hotel concierge in washington dc and take my word  there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by michael j . fox    we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and     bills    if i ever let anybody use a room for some  afternoon delight  time i  d be fired on the spot  the organization to which i belong  les clefs d  or  has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously .   similarly untrue was the concept  at the end of the movie  of doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee  we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them . there is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization .  br    br   this film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary . in short it does a disservice to our organization . i welcome any comments .
