awful . this thriller should have buried . what a piece of crap . terrible writing  characters are less than believable . horrible schlock   stick some b  stars in a terribly written pos to try and give it a little credit  but it fails miserably . if i didn  t have to write ten lines about this movie i would have given it a word word review  it starts with  sh  and ends with  it  .  br    br   horrible ending  retarded . who writes this crap . the ending of this film is so contrived  weak it  s as if they had no idea what to do with this story line  or they just ran out of money . most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie . it  s a good thing that these actors are on the way out  because this would be a career killer . good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it . at least no one important  like future investors . it could have ended a thousand different ways  but as it is  i feel cheated out of my precious time .  br    br   don  t bother with this one  you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back .
