i had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school . as figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new . though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through . it had an interesting side to it but it just doesn  t live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original . we have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him  we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust  then we have the father who is always gone . then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does . on to the story like i said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling . everything about this fell into clich the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl  they get together  have sex and then boom we have a little kid . perhaps it could  ve been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved i  ve seriously gotten more emotion out of leatherface and his chainsaw than i did out of any actor in this film and that  s pretty bad seeing as the leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted . so far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie i  ve seen was juno . so far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message . like i said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity . i really hope someone decides to either re  make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential .
