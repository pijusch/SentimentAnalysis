as someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true  life tale  i was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been .  br    br   the bad  i  m a fan of robert duvall and many of the characters he has played  but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator .  br    br   the dialog is insipid and the pretty kathryn harrold is real garbage  mouth . from what i read  there were several directors replacing each other on this film  and that  s too bad . you can tell things aren  t right with the story . i couldn  t get  involved  with treat williams  portrayal of cooper  either . he should have been fascinating  but he wasn  t in this movie . it  s also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of  folk hero   but i admit i wound up rooting for the guy  too .  br    br   not everything was disappointing . i can  t complain about the scenery  from the lush  green forests of oregon to the desert in arizona .  br    br   i  d like to see this movie re  made and done better  because it is a one  of  a  kind story .
