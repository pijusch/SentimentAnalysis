over the years i  ve seen a bunch of these straight to video segal movies  and every one holds the same amount of entertainment unfortanetley  the entertainment level is at a low . sure  the action sequences were amusing  but that was pretty much it . seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like under siege  under siege   and executive decision  at least on the action standpoint   but during the past ten years  these types of movies that star segal really do not meet his past qualifications .  br    br   on the more positive side  the movie did make good use of time  like some of the action sequences and use of wit . just when the movie seemed to just drag on  a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter . i honestly believe that more of segal  s movies would do better if he wasn  t the only one that fans recognize in the movie . supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing  and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses  maybe the movie will get more popular results .
