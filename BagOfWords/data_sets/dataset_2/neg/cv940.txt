the directors cut version  which was the one i saw  was very long for this type of movie . almost two hours is way too long . if you have the choice  definitely go for the non  directors cut .  br    br   the main plot is almost not taken up at all  the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes  which are connected but the feeling is that they  re only shown in order to fill the movie with splatterish violence . the connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before i was there .  br    br   as a horror movie it doesn  t work . you never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition  character is presented    minutes later character is dead  . this pictures strong side lies in the splatter part .
