the  wrinkle in time  book series is my favorite series from childhood . i have read and re  read them more times than i can count over the last    years . the characters  with all their virtues and flaws  are near and dear to my heart . this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful  magical  spiritual story that i love so much . to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement .  br    br   if you have never read the book  s  i imagine you will enjoy the movie . the acting is passable  the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie  and the story is interesting . however  if you love the books  avoid this movie at all costs .  br    br   i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel  in an interview with newsweek  l  engle said of the film   i expected it to be bad  and it is .    br    br   i  like another reviewer here  feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind .
