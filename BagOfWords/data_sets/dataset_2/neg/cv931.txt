this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a children  s comic  i gave it  out of   for it  s attention to detail because for the most part it had a   s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make  up was good .  br    br   this was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally  usually seen in one of their biographies . no interviews with surviving cast members  crew members  production team members etc .  or their friends  families  and any biographers of those people . in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the  supposedly  biographical book . as for actually learning something that no  one knew about the program and wasn  t common knowledge well that never happened .
