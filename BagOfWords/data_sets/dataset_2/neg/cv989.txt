i saw the trailer to this film and it looked great  so i went out and bought it . what a mistake  the acting is a shambles  the special effects  if you could call them that   look like something that wouldn  t be out of place at a school play . some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen  which unfortunately is all to often . as for a story  forget it . this is a warning  don  t waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things i have ever seen . if  for some reason  you like this film watch troll   you will probably enjoy that as well .
