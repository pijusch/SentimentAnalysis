the finale of the weissmuller tarzan movies is a rather weak one . there are a few things that derail this film .  br    br   first  tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals . in my opinion  any footwear on tarzan  whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed  takes away from the character  which is supposed to be anti  civilization and pro  jungle .  br    br   second  the character of benji  as mentioned in a previous post  totally derails the movie as the comic foil . to me  his character is unnecessary to the film  s plot .  br    br   also  while weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as tarzan  it  s apparent that he was not in his best shape . although in his later jungle jim movies  his physique had improved somewhat from this film .  br    br   the octopus battle is a terrific idea  but i think it should have been done in an earlier weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak . likewise  the battle  which takes only   seconds tops  would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to   seconds to  minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in tarzan and his mate .  br    br   and while brenda joyce as jane and linda christian as mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye  it doesn  t manage to salvage this last weissmuller film  a disappointing ending to a great character run .
