this abc straight  to  tv failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is a wrinkle in time . ms . madeleine l  engle brought children and adults alike into a magical  fantastical and original world like no author before her . this novel  the first in her  time quartet   is a beautiful take on life  the universe  and time itself . yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand . its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book . this film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of ms . l  engle  s work of art . honestly  what were they thinking  the effects look cheap and ridiculous  the plot is mushy and uneven  the dialogue is far  fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost . this was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen . i sincerely hope that someday an intelligent  worthy director  guillermo del toro  david yates  alfonso cuarn  makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is a masterpiece . this adaptation can only be compared to boring  fake and cheap motel  room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience .
