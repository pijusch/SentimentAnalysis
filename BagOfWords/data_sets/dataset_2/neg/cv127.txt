this is one of the worst films ever . i like cheesy movies but this is simply awful . where are the images in the film that are on the box  i think more money was spent on the dvd box illustrations than on the entire film .  br    br   why would a company release a dvd that the cover is so misleading  i feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box . as much as i explore imdb i should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store . i have no one to blame except myself . i want my money and time back .  br    br   do not watch this movie .  br    br   even if curiosity is motivating you  stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead . it will be much more enjoyable . you have been warned
