want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work  just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a gentleman  s club . that  s what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end . this is the worst slasher film i have ever seen  but every time i was ready to switch the channel  they  d add another scene with the workout girls and i  d stay put . as a slasher film  killer workout fails in every category i can think of . as a showcase for beautiful girls working out  it is a success . strong recommendation to avoid  unless the thought of half the film being a big ta show appeals to you .
