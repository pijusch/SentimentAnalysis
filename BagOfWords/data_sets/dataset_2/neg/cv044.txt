ok  i am not japanese . i do know a little about japanese culture  and a little less about japanese pop culture . other than that  i am spanish  i eat paella and i like black humor .  br    br   good  with that point set  i can comment on the movie i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences  mamoru oshii is quite a good director  despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head  and even that was curious and somehow interesting  and i am surprised he came up with this . it may just be one of those lost  in  translation cases  i am afraid it is  but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitles i just thought it was horrible . the jokes seemed bad  the script was overcooked  i mean  give the audience a break  and shut up a little you damn narrator  to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast  paced speaking and absurd action .  br    br   however  i thought the animation was really cool . the idea is great  and it is well exploited in those animated scenes . however  the eye  candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo  jumbo speech over still pictures . it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut  out hysterical characters scene .  br    br   i read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this . the idea was good but horribly exploited . maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie  or maybe it will be more and more over  narrated scenes . but hell  if you thought talking head was dense  amazing lifes of fast food gifters will give cause you a stroke .  br    br   of course  all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european . probably this is totally useless to japanese people  maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation . maybe .
