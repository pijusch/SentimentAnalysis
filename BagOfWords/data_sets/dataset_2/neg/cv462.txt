before seeing this movie  i would  ve said that i loved everything kathy bates has done . now it  s everything  minus  one . james woods is pathetic . . . not his character  his acting . someone should  ve told him that  poor  is not synonymous with dirty  nor ignorant  nor cliche . ditto for randy quaid  s stereotyping . the only redeeming feature is henry thomas  who isn  t a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess . if you enjoy the country  you  ll enjoy the scenery . that  s the best i can give it .  br    br   i  m a serious fan of both independent and quirky films  but this is simply terrible .
