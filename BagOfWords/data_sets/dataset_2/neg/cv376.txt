how did mike hammer live  in a penthouse with a golf bag stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube tv and a snazzy fireplace  nah  he  d knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his fly  specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown la flop house  wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face  that  s how . spillane wrote trash paperbacks  for sure  but how do you make it worse  give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any film noir titled crap will sell at the box office  add some over  the  hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw  up the story  line by some retard  drugged out screen writer  that  s how
