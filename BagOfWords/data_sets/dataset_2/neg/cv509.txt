disjointed  unclear  bad screenplay  poor photography and direction . . . all in all very obviously an ill  conceived first effort at commercial film  making by the good people at tbn .  br    br   tbn pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring  china cry   the story of nora lam  to the big screen . but  the omega code  is an unfortunate miscue . as a christian who supports tbn and a lot of its programming and who loved  china cry   i still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone . they do much good with their ministry  but this isn  t an example of it . don  t waste your money . . . go rent  china cry  instead .
