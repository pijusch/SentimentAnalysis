this movie is one long chiche after another . first of all  though they did their share  there is a unwarranted dope scene where john sniffs weed like an idiot . the wigs and accents are terrible . they sound worse then the old beatle cartoons . john is the nasty  envious  closet homosexual  slave to yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited albert goldman book . they even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation  it was always just the two of us   john would not have been mean to his fans like this either . like his death showed us he was too nice if anything . the one funny scene is where a dumb beatle fan only recognizes john and asks him to sing paul  s yesterday . an insulted john says something along the lines of  sure and while i croon why don  t you get down on your knees  put on your wife  s wig  and lick my liggin  . that made me laugh for days . really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous . john and paul also did not sit pontificating all day  they were funny light hearted guys who even during the beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here . forget it .
