the film is about sir christopher strong  mp   member of parliament   played by colin clive  and his affair with the amelia earhart  like character played by katherine hepburn . up until they met  he had been a very devoted husband but when he met the odd but fascinating hepburn  he  couldn  t help himself  and they fell in love . you can tell  because they stare off into space a lot and talk endlessly about how painful their unrequited love is . frankly  this is a terribly dated and practically impossible film to watch . part of the problem is that in the pre  code days  films glamorizing adultery were very common . plus  even if you accept this morally suspect subject  the utter sappiness of the dialog make it sound like a   th century romance novel . . . and a really bad one at that . sticky and with difficult to like characters  after all  clive  s wife is a nice lady and did no one any harm  make this one a big waste of time . about the only interesting aspect of this film is the costume hepburn wears in an early scene where she is dressed in a moth costume  you  ve gotta see it to believe it   and she looks like one of the bugaloos  an obscure  but fitting reference  .
