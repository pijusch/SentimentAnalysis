i  ve read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained . this movie is nothing . it  s so badly written  directed and acted that it barely makes an impression . the characters speak in cliche  ridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible . while that might make this campy and fun  it doesn  t because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull . it  s as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasn  t allowed by studio execs to give the story some true  to  life gusto or didn  t have the cojones . this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard  issue bad lifetime tv movie .
