i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was . was the viewer supposed to learn something  or reflect on anything here  what was up with the pumpkins  was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots  does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel  why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews  it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery  . the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished .  br    br   i am truly amazed . i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community .
