who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i . gordon  s legendary bad trash  film  food of the gods   nobody  of course  but director damien lee thought it was a good idea  anyway  and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history .  gnaw  is a sequel in name only  as the setting moved to a typical late    s location  a university campus  and also the cheap  cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the    s . this script hangs together by clichs  awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other  and more successful  horror classics . neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growing  experiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor . due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists  the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus . following the good old tradition that spielberg  s  jaws  started  there  s an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere . during a hysterically grotesque climax  the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus  new sport complex   gnaw food of the gods   is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch  the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff  like descending into the sewers unarmed while they know it  s infested with rats   the acting is atrocious and there  s a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growth  serum  i wonder what freud  s theory would be on that  there  s a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and  it has to be said  the music is surprisingly atmospheric . in case you just can  t get enough of this junk  there are quite a lot of creature  features revolving on mutated rats  like the italian schlock film  rats night of terror   the modest    s cult film  willard  and its lame sequel  ben   the      willard  remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent rat  movies by once  famous directors tibor ticaks   rats   and john lafia   the rats   . go nuts
