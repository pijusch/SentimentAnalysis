i didn  t expect a movie as good as  in the line of fire  or an episode of      but it looked like this movie was made for tv and did a mediocre job at best . the  good  cast couldn  t disguise the fact that the plot was all too predictable and actors had to struggle  they really try their best i think  through their lines of bad script  giving their rather flat characters any extras . when i watched the movie i got the feeling that i had seen most of this in other  better  movies . in it you had car chases  big shootouts  romance  plot twists etc . etc this movie has none .  br    br    spoiler as soon as you see another woman talking into the phone to cuba  s character  you know who  s behind all this and all the hints you  re being given   you stand too close to the president  see it from my perspective . .   sound silly .  br    br   if it were up to me  and maybe it  s a good thing that it isn  t  i would rewrite the plot like this  br    br   first lady orders the murder of her husband because she is sick and tired of writing checks to cuba all the time .
