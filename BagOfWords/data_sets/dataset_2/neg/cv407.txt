this movie was poorly written  poorly acted and very predictable . it was very low  budget and i can understand why it was never released and went straight to video . it wasn  t even campy fun  it was just a complete disaster and i wish i could get the      hours back  the colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them .  br    br   the plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing   what a stretch  skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre . just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this .  br    br   ejames
