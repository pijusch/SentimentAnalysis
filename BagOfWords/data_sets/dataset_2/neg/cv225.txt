murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made  for  tv but isn  t . considering the only actor of any note is bullock  although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things   it isn  t a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things . like . . . remembering to lock your front door when you go out . or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower .  br    br   bullock plays cassie mayweather  a cop with personal issues  don  t they all  . together with her new partner  a wet  looking ben chaplin   she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman . nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they  ve planned and executed the perfect murder . as the investigation continues  a battle of wills emerges between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood  ryan gosling  .  br    br   the crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless . bullock  though she is very nice to look at  is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield  actually  he  d be better   . chaplin  for his sins  is a complete non  entity and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood . at least gosling and pitt  as the conniving sneering suspects  acquit themselves adequately . as if dodgy leads weren  t bad enough  a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable  but illogical  ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run .  br    br    murder by numbers  has absolutely nothing going for it  even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldn  t redeem it . well  just a little but still not enough to save it . forgettable  predictable and redundant  this is one film that isn  t going to move the cop genre forward . as cassie probably says on her next case  there  s nothing to see here people . move along  keep moving . . .
