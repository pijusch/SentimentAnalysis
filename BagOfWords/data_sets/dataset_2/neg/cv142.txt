he was my hero for all time until he went along with if you can call it a movie i went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero  s acting and the hole thing was . . . . . . . . . . . . . i can  t believe that steven segal  s career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making  th rate films with  th rate secondary actors . i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does . when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong .  br    br   the plot is unbelievable as a movie  and even if you excuse the visuals  and had read this story as a novel  you  d be left wondering why you had even picked up the book .  br    br   steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation . he shows no effort and no enthusiasm  and in some scenes he doesn  t show up at all .  br    br   i hate to repeat other peoples comments  but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic . the condition of those scenes chopped in  is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time . the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner .  br    br   my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie  it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds . i read one review that said the movie had a   million dollar budget  segal being paid  of that  and that the movie still came in under budget . i must concur .  br    br   it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie  as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie .
