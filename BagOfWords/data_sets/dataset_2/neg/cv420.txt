film starts in     japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide . it  s a very gory  bloody sequence . then it jumps to present day . . . well     to be precise . ted  edward albert   wife laura  susan george  and their annoying little kid move to japan for hubby  s work . they rent a house and   surprise  surprise   it just happens to be the house where the murders took place  the three dead people are around as ghosts  the makeup is hysterically bad  and make life hell for the family .  br    br   sounds ok   but it  s really hopeless . there  s a bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in between . there is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious  they look so fake   i swear i saw the strings pulling one along   and they  re muttering      there  s a pointless sex sequence in the first   minutes  probably just to show off george  s body   another one about   minutes later  but that was necessary to the plot  and a really silly exorcism towards the end . the fight scene between albert and doug mcclure must be seen to be believed .  br    br   as for acting   albert was ok as the husband and mcclure was pretty good as a family friend . but george   as always   is terrific in a lousy film . she gives this film a much needed lift   but can  t save it . i  m giving this a  just for her and the gory opening and closing . that aside  this is a very boring film .
