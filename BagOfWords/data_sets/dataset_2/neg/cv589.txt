disappointing musical version of margaret landon  s  anna and the king of siam   itself filmed in     with irene dunne and rex harrison  has deborah kerr cast as a widowed schoolteacher and mother who travels from england to siam in     to accept job as tutor to the king  s many children   and perhaps teach the royal one a thing or two in the process  stagy picture begins well  but quickly loses energy and focus . yul brynner  reprising his stage triumph as the king  is a commanding presence  but is used   per the concocted story   as a buffoon . kerr keeps her cool dignity and fares better  despite having to lip  synch to marni nixon  s vocals . perhaps having already played this part to death  brynner looks like he had nothing leftover for the screen translation except bombast . second  half  with anna and the moppets staging a musical version of  uncle tom  s cabin  is quite ridiculous  and the rodgers and hammerstein songs are mostly lumbering . brynner won a best actor oscar  but it is feisty kerr who keeps this bauble above water . overlong  heavy  and  old  fashioned  in the worst sense of the term .  from
