this was an atrocious waste of my time . no plot . the acting was so far below par  it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what not to do . it is merely a commercial rip  off of the earlier universal soldier  which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel . its sad that vd needs to assert his ego every few years  and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it . this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name . by comparison  it makes segall  norris  and arnold look almost talented .  br    br   perhaps vd should take the leslie nielson track and do send  ups of his genre . at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him .
