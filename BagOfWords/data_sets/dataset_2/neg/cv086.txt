boy  girl love affair  sequel with songs  only this time she  s the punkette and he  s the straight arrow . movie  buffs out there actually like this movie  it has fans  i must say  the mind reels . . .  grease   is a truly lame enterprise that doesn  t even have the courage  moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames  like  jaws   or  exorcist ii   . no  it whimpers along in slow  motion and often just plays dead . it looks and feels cheap  with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling . this was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of michelle pfeiffer and  although she doesn  t embarrass herself  it  s a role worth forgetting . a misfire on the lowest of levels . no stars from
