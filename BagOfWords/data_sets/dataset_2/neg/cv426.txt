 . . it  s this one  very cool premise  right off the bat .  br    br   has an excellent first scene  gotta give credit where credit  s due .  br    br   has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me whenever the ghosts appeared  which i really liked by the way how it was done  how it looked . . . the only thing was the ghost  s relationship . because of the way things went down in the first scene you  d think their dynamic would be different .  br    br   things slowed down a little too much in the middle i felt  and the crab  spider scene was just not good . but then the ending is actually very good  sure   the grudge  basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurai  s and that  s what i liked about this movie comparatively .  br    br   please  someone one with a tempered style remake this movie .  br    br   fans of  silent rage  would absolutely love this movie .
