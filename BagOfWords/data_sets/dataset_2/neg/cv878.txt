terrible movie . if there is one turkish film you should avoid seeing in      that should be banyo . what a waste of time . other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing  nada  zilch  nil . the dialog is cheap  and sexual clichs are all over it . the director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own . the red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do . if you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting . the only good thing i can say about the movie is  wait  wait  there is nothing good i can say about it . i must have really disliked it to write about it this much . jeez
