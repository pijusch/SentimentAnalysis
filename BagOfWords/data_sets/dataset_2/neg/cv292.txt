yes  the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner matt monro . it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature  stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond . add in harry andrews  with a strange accent  no less  chasing an ostrich  tons of stock footage of wildlife  and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard  and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of senegal .
