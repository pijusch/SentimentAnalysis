this is probably the most boring  worse and useless film i have seen last year . the plot that was meant to have some philosophical aspects emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix  with plenty of clichs the lone wolf cop  good looking  psychologically disturbed  sleeping with his gun . . .  nice hard worker and shy  but good looking she  scientist  you add a  cent plot and you have i  robot  i was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands like fedex  audi  converse etc . this movie stinks the commercialization and tend to be more a poor ad spot that unfortunately will not end after   sec . i wouldn  t recommend this to my worse enemy  if you have some spare time  watch a good tv program instead or better read a nice book .
