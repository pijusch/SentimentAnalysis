i really didn  t like this movie because it didn  t really bring across the messages and ideas l  engle brought out in her novel . we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it  i  m afraid i can  t say the same for the film . there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn  t do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine l  engle  this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating . don  t see this movie if you are a big fan of l  engle  s texts because you will be sorely disappointed . however  if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes  or educational as was my case  then it is an alright movie
