i had some expectation for the movie  since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of akshay and saif . well  i was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for dhoom franchise because i hated dhoom   but if dhoom  is compared to tashan  i would say dhoom  is very realistic .  br    br   when i saw the credits at the beginning  i felt nice because it was put up in a nice way . well  the very first scene itself pised me off . then  the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences . me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights . it was like akshay against some   thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns  phew . . . you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are .  br    br   the other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story . it reminded me of some of the early    s movies .  br    br   well  the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy kareena  who looked really hot in this one . and for that  i give a rating of  out of   .  br    br   guys  please . . please . . . don  t see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie . well  you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes .  br    br   thats all .
