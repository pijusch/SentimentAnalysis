i can  t believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of   it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring  certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a long  long time .  br    br   in a no  budget way  it reminded me of star wars episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck .  br    br   this film should be avoided at all costs . it  s one of those  festival films  that only please the pseudo  intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it  different   therefore good .  br    br   bad film  making is not  different   it  s just bad film  making .
