i saw the   p . m . showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special . although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back  as i don  t actually pay for movies anymore  i didn  t really find any redeeming qualities .  br    br   there were a few lines and such that made me chuckle  but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger  in mind more than age as this film is rated r  male audience . the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well . i know you all want to hear samuel l . say his infamous line  but let  s be honest  it  s a whole lot of hype for very little pay off . the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg  which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen .  br    br   now i am a reasonable man  i knew going into the theater that i wasn  t going to be seeing  casablanka   and i am at least thankful that this film is an original  albiet inane  idea and not some re  make or franchise spin off . however to be honest  if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months .
