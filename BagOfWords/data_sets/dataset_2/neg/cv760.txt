predictable  hackneyed  poorly written . foolishly i reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit . i guess competition amongst actors is so intense these days  and will only get worse  that one cannot pick and choose much any more . early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since . the movie lacked intrigue  giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder . some of the discourse was  frankly  embarrassing  it  s hard to believe anyone would even consider  let alone commit to  the spending of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe .
