ok  so it was written in      before      so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world  is prescient . that  s it . that  s the good stuff . the acting . . . fair . the plot . . . silly . the  twist  . . . unnecessary . dooooooooooom it isn  t as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated . don  t you think bureaucrats have a manual for  plagues  and how to contain them  proper execution of such a plan is always a problem  as we saw after katrina . but they have a plan . it isn  t to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania . and if the virus is carried in the air  why was the plane door open and the  shooters  standing there with no protection  in fact  did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs  that would stop her . but not as dramatic . i  m a sucker . i always watch a movie to see the end  once i started it . but this was a waste of time  and for the most part  predictable . i saw it using a recorder so i didn  t have to watch all the ads  that was a plus . it  s a good example of why i watch so little network tv . rubbish .
