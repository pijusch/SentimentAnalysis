when thinking of the revelation that the main character in  bubble  comes to at films end  i am reminded of last years  machinist  with christian bale . the only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters .  br    br   an understated  yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life . the title is cause for contemplation . perhaps  we  the audience are the ones in the  bubble  as we are given no payoffs in the films slim   minute running time . audience reactions were often smug and judgmental  clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves . these characters are the ones people refer to as those that put george w . back in office for a second term .  br    br   it  s sobering to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role . this film has it  s merits  and is deserving of consideration for the things it doesn  t say outright .
