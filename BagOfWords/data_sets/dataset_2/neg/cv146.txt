well  i can once and for all put an end to the question  what is the worst movie ever made . . . ever   it is flight of fury  starring and co  written by steven seagal . sure there are lots of famously bad movies  but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously .  br    br   it is a romanian  made film that speaks to just how far romania has to go to catch up with bollywood . it also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent steven seagal has become . this movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry  knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again .  br    br   it was released only on video  i can  t imagine why  and i suspect the workers that had to make the dvd  s had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling .
