did heidijean really see this movie  a great christmas movie  not even close . dull  bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart . i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie  the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance . baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing . probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with . maybe i  m expecting too much for a lifetime movie played   days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie .
