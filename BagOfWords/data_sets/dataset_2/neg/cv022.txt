i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments . it  s not a bad movie exactly  but it  s one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre . plus  it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways  and the characters  behavior often strains belief . i  d say its a film that you would get something out of if you don  t have a lot of film  tv  literature  life behind you  to be honest  i  ve seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even  . otherwise  its point has been made before and more artfully . and that gets to the big problem  which is that it really doesn  t have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point . it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling  and it doesn  t really pay off .
