elvis has left the building and he  s lucky because he didn  t have to watch this unfunny stinker . scene after scene director joel zwick finds ways to make an unfunny script even less amusing . filled with unfunny deaths  trite gay characteratures  and hack jokes  this film is more desperate than amusing . this is the sort of film that makes one hope kim basinger follows doris day into premature retirement . let us remember her the way she was  talented  and not what she  s become . david leisure  the delicious dennis richards and the rest are all wasted talents here . zwick finds a way to minimize their talents at every turn . the guy playing elvis sounds more like gomer than the king . the only really good bit of casting is the young girl who plays basinger as a preteen . she really looks like her and is actually pretty good . the only other reason to watch this film at all is to look for the tom hanks cameo . the cameo isn  t all that funny  but at least its not painful . one has to wonder if zwick has incriminating pictures of hanks or something that would make him do this movie .
