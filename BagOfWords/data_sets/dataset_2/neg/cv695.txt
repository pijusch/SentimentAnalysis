this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any real evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example bart sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldn  t there be two or more shadows for each object when apollo   went through the van allan radiation belts they spent   min  s there not the   min  s claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray .  br    br   seriously do some research learn what really happened don  t let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened
