you have to figure that when the star  s name is listed wrong in the opening credits  you are not in for a good time  the credit reads  cuba gooding  j . r .   . some nice car chase  shoot  em up  blow  em up action if all you want is action  because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best  and completely unbelievable . the motivations of the characters  especially that of gooding  s at the end  are worse then unbelievable  they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled . all i can think is that andy cheng must be a really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul a project  he can  t have something on all of them  can he   .
