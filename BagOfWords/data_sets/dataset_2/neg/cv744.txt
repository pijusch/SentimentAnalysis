flat characters that you do not and never will care about . cringe  inducing dialogue at places . no twists  they think they have one  but if you didn  t figure it out after about   mins you  re not too bright  . lots of well know actors in roles and performances that  fortunately for everyone involved  will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll .  br    br   i don  t mind  slow  movies  but they  ve got to be going  somewhere  . this one doesn  t .  br    br   the plot wasn  t what made this a direct  to  dvd movie  that  s just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake controversy .  br    br   the as  of  writing      ten     ratings must be from people involved with the production .
