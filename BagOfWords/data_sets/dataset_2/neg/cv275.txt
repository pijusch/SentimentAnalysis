end of the world looks like a good movie on the box cover but be warned its bad . being a big fan of mega star actor christopher lee i was fooled . like tentacles     a good cast does not mean it  ll be a good film . the beginning looks promising then it turns to tedium  many parts of the movie are too dark to see whats going on . the rest of the cast is shown briefly likelew ayres  dean jagger  and macdonald carey as a security guard . i would expect better from charles band who made good fun movies like the re  animater and dolls . i heard christopher lee was tricked into making this film . he was told his co stars were going to be jose ferrer  john carridine  and dean jagger . well dean jagger is there but the other two never made it  lucky them  if you make a movie about the end of the world use a bigger budget and better storyline . dean jagger went on to do two good movies afterwardsalligator     and game of death     sue lyon  lolita  is also in the movie minus her lollipop . if you are a glutton for punishment then watch end of the world i dare you to say awake during the whole movie .  out of   .
