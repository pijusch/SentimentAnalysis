at first i was convinced that this was a made  for  tv movie that wasn  t worthy of primetime . but after a few minutes of dumb  struck awe  i realized that there was at least comic value in the over  the  top stunts and c  movie acting . this movie would have gotten a  if my wife and i hadn  t laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face . it was like a less  funny spy version of the big hit  i laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd  with even  worse acting . we were disappointed that nick chose to marry elena  and not jim  after all of the hugging and high  fives . a few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier .
