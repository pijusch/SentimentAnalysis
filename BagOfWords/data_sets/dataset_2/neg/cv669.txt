this movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because jean  claud vam damme stars in this movie . there are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie .  br    br   the acting in this movie is so bad and its the worst acting i have ever seen and the  actors bill goldberg and michael jai white can not act at all . and this movie by far has to be one of jean  claud vam dammes worst movies he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies u should watch blood sport  kickboxer or sudden death .  br    br   over all this movie is crap  ok and my rating is  out of   .
