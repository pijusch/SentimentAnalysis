 . . . but a lousy film . as maltin says this was christopher lee  s attempt to make a serious horror film . well  it is serious . . . too serious  the plot is silly and slow  something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality  . . . the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again . i actually dozed off a few times  the film is sooooo dull  the cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of peter cushing and lee . . . but this was probably a labor of love for both  they often complained about horror movies being too violent . . . well  this has no violence   . avoid at all costs . . . unless you have insomnia . . . this will put you to sleep
