the only reason i dvrd this movie was because  . i live in cleveland and shaq plays basketball for us now and  . i  ve always heard how awful it was . the movie did not disappoint . the best parts were shaq  s outfits . the worst parts were  well  just about everything else . my   year old son and i just squirmed and couldn  t look at the screen when shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why max didn  t wish for kazzam to fix that front tooth of his  but for all it  s terribleness we just couldn  t stop watching it  the story sucked you in  like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit  it was hypnotic . but it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched  kazzam  .
