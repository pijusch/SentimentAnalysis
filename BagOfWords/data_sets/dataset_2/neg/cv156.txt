this movie should have never been made .  br    br   what a shame of the budget .  br    br   please hire convincing actors  and make a proper movie . very thin plot  and unconvincing lines . almost hilarious  and that is a shame for an action movie . . . .  br    br   definitely not worth watching .  br    br   they keep replaying the same  shots  of an stealth airplane flying away . you have seen it ones  and that was not worth re  running  or  times .  br    br   it is time for steven seagal to retire from movie  making .  br    br   his movies are getting worser every time .  br    br   black dawn  and submerged were already bad  but this movie is even worse .
