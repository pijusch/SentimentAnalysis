based upon the recommendation of a friend  my wife and i invited another couple to this film . i really apologized to them   all  of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end . half the vignettes are bizarre  with very little entertainment value . there were few scenes of paris   for example  i was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the latin quarter  but i couldn  t really recognize anything . most of the scene was inside a bar . no one in the theater laughed at anything  or reacted in any way . if you like bizarre  pretentious  pseudo  intellectual films  don  t miss this . if you are down to earth like me  you will be sorry you saw it .
