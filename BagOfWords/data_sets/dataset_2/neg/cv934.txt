it was everything this isn  t it had pace  pop  and actors who weren  t afraid to chew the scenery . it also had a decent script . this one had me scratching my head . if farrah isn  t really  serious  about a career  why does she have a manager  and why is he wasting his time   if kate and barney are  artists   why do they sign up for the mother of all jiggle shows  like the  brady bunch  movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare  only to find himself on bb   they weren  t industry names  but they weren  t exactly starving  either . and while they got the history right  the poster was released before farrah got the show   silverman rejecting pitches for  funniest home videos  and  american idol  and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday he  ll create a show for her obviously did not happen .  br    br   what bothered me was how spelling  s role is distorted . he  s shown as the show  runner and creator when he was neither . and how he  comes up  with the  idea  for ca was is laughable   br    br   how were spelling and goldberg allowed to enforce farrah  s oral contract when the others were signed  and why didn  t farrah or bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner diva  but because majors wanted her to  this is why  when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the  bad girl   like suzanne somers   it fails because the groundwork was never laid   that was where the  three  s company  pic delivered .
