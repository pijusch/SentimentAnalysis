this is one very dire production . the general consensus has always been that while princess margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal  she was a very beautiful young woman . here was the production  s weakest point  the actress failed to get that across . it also appeared that the production budget couldn  t stretch to a hairdresser  from the outset  the hair on the princess margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush . the actor playing the duke of edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching rory bremner imitate prince charles and was farcical .  br    br   the production was a flaw ridden  clich ridden  embarrassing load of rubbish . i think all daily mail readers deserve a free dvd copy for christmas
