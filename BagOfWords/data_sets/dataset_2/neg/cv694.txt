i am a   th grader at my high school . in my current world affairs class a kid in my class had this video and suggested we watch . so we did . i am firm believer that we went to the moon  being that my father works for nasa . even though i think this movie is the biggest piece of crap i have ever watched  the guy who created it has some serious balls . first of all did he have to show jfk getting shot  and how dare he use all those biblical quotes . the only good thing about this movie is it sparks debates  which is good b  c in my class we have weekly debates . this movie did nothing to change my mind . i think he and michael moore should be working together and make another movie . michael moore next movie could be called  a funny thing happened on spetember   th  or  a funny thing happened on the way to the white house  .
