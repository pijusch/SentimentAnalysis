i bought this movie for  euro  not knowing what it was all about . i thought  hmmm  a movie named mutilation man must be if not very funny at least filled with gore  . it wasn  t funny alright . it was disturbing . very disturbing . and i don  t mind disturbing movies but this one just didn  t mean anything  except that child abuse is not a good thing to do . hmmm . . . the quality of the images were terrible . the acting . . . there was no acting . just some fcked  up fcker mutilating himself for over   minutes . this is probably material for sicko  s jurking off on extreme gore .  br    br   don  t watch this . it  s not worth your time . its just awful . i wish i never bought this .  br    br   they should mutilate the guy who made this
