if you watched this movie you know why i said  jesus  jesus  jesus  . hehehe    every time they said  jesus  jesus  jesus  . . . i laughed thinking  jesus  jesus  jesus  why did i rent this movie   i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen . wtf is timberlake  dreaful acting  i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job  this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him . . . but i really prefer an actor  not this android called timberlake . and his girlfriend was shallow  hollow and annoying as hell . i was happy when they both were popped in the street .  br    br   the story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well . the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all . it would have been much enjoyable without him .  br    br   by the way  the music was ok  but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes  low motion and things like that . something misplaced for this cops movie i thought . maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake .
