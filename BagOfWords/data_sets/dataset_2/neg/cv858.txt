i just watched this horrid thing on tv . needless to say it is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get . frankly  i don  t know how much lower the bar can go .  br    br   the characters are composed of one lame stereo  type after another  and the obvious attempt at creating another  bad news bears  is embarrassing to say the very least .  br    br   i have seen some prized turkeys in my time  but there is no reason to list any of them since this is  numero uno  .  br    br   let me put it to you this way  i watched the vanilla ice movie  because it was so bad it was funny . this . . . this . . . is not even that good .
