to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite . i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn  t mean it is a terrorist thing . it also show  s how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype  by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesn  t mean we are all bad we just try to live  day at a time  like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like  blow up  or yaser saying we  ll blow away the competition  and people took it the wrong way . being a muslim i know that stuff like this don  t usually happen  but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq  its not right things are not like that . people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act . i am glad a show like this came on the air . there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terrorists  many people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair  but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name .
