this film had so much promise . i was very excited about this film . in the end  it was laughable at best  painful at worst . the acting styles ran the gamut from really  really  flat  the angels  the wife and daughter  to over  animated  casper  s character  . i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other . pay special attention to the scene regarding  the bug  . it  s pretty much an insult to the audience  s ability to figure things out . in defense of that scene  though  it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie . i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations . too bad they didn  t make use of it . i didn  t feel like i was transported to exotic locations . anybody could insert stock footage of the coliseum in rome . however  to end on a positive note  i thought the sets were pretty good . i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers . it is my opinion  and that  s all it is  that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased  this film would have been good .
