this must be one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen  the graphics are ridiculous  and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process .  br    br   i like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie  so i can  t say i  m picky . i have been struggling to find something to compare it to  but i just can  t think of anything that matches this  maybe starship troopers  . witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player  but compared to this its effects are great . the acting superb and the script should be awarded . you know when a movie is bad in a funny way  well folks this isn  t one of those this kills your soul minute by minute .
