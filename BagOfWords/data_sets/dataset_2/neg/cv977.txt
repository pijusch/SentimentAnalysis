this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen  and i have quite an appetite for awful  and good  movies . it could  just  have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue  in  cheek    la rocky horror picture show  which was really very funny . other movies  like plan nine from outer space  manage to be funny while  apparently  trying to be serious . as to the acting  it looks like they rounded up brain  dead teenagers and asked them to ad  lib the whole production . compared to them  tom cruise looks like alec guinness . there was one decent interpretation   that of the older ghoul  busting broad on the motorcycle .
