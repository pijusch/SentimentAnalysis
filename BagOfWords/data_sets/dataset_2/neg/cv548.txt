on steve irwin  s show  he  s hillarious . he doesn  t even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasn  t even what i would call a movie  i mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him he  s just saying  oh  this is one nasty bloke   and looking straight into the camera . he put his face in the camera too much  and then when the guy falls off the car wouldn  t you expect him to be dead  and terri had the worst acting i  d ever seen  like when the crocodile almost ate steve she just says  steve  . she didn  t sound scared or anything  it was just  steve  . i mean i hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing . i love steve irwin but his movie was just too stupid .
