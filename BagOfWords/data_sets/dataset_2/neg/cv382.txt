saw this film ran in the wee hours on tcm . several problems with the film were apparent from what i saw . first  the adults did not age when the children did for   years . several parts of the film had continuity problems  for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the   years passed .  br    br   the copy i saw was missing about   minutes or so  at least a huge gap with black screen appeared . it is too bad  because even though the script left something to be desired  bergman  russell both did fine in the film in their roles . it is a shame the large chunk is missing  but what is here is watchable .  br    br   i just wish it was all intact . the script makes little sense in that bergman  s character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults  some of the time lines don  t make sense either . there is a stock market crash that resembles     but the kids grow up to fight in world war  . all the acting by the support folks in this film is fine . just wonder what was in the   gap of film i could not see as it was missing .
