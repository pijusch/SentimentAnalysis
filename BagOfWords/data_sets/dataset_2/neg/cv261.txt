the only reason i give it a  is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on .  br    br   this film is asinine . it  s like so many other   st century grind house fodder . the gore is gratuitous and simply revolting . i didn  t care about any of the characters  but i did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap i  d complain about the money i spent  but my date and i wisely left after   minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining  live free or die hard   which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because i endured the utter poop of  captivity  for   minutes .
