there was not one original idea in this story . themes were pulled from various sources a few being the ninth gate  in the mouth of madness  another carpenter film   and the ring . it even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from the ring and using it as the film  s namesake . the soundtrack by cody carpenter was all but lifted from suspiria . hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word homage around . yes  i saw that the theater was playing argento  s deep red . claiming an homage would be a bullshit cop  out . this was bottom  of  the  barrel . throwing gore and  disturbing  imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film . carpenter used to know that . he should fade into obscurity or acquire a time machine .
