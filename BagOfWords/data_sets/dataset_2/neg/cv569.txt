i rented this flick for one reason tom savini  i respect his work but this was a real let down  i had horrible clichs  half of the film was naked women so called  fallen angels  running around trying to act scary  oh and then there was the occasional  blair witch  black and white motion sicken camera scenes . tom  s character was really awful  horrible script . and you got to love these lines they use .  is anyone there  who is out there  this isn  t funny  no but your acting was . i wish i could give this flick a   oh the names of the characters . judd  molly  ally  emilio  but they did leave out anthony  the breakfast club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting .
