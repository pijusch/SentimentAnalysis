you can give jms and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget  but the movie is still sub  par . dont get me wrong  b  the series is by far the best tv series ever  but if i was an exec seeing this movie  i wouldnt have ordered the series . i dont like o  hare as an actor  the costumes are silly  and there are tons of cliches . the same can be said for most of the first season  with the exception of babylon squared and survivors   bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle . if you are a b  fan and havent seen this movie  see it . if you arent a b  fan  dont . . . you wont want to watch the series .
