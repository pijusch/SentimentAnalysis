it has a great name  but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money  in fact the first      mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gone .  br    br   and yet the producers  roberto angel salcedo  calls him an actor  but i don  t think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting   . . . . period . the little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing .  br    br   for some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it  but they didn  t   and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad  i don  t buy it .  br    br   but hopefully this is as bad as it gets . to make people accept those dvd  s to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it  that might work out .  br    br   maka
