i can  t say this is the worst film of all time  but only because there are still some movies i haven  t seen  yet  this has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time  the director suffers from the same issues he had with  there will be blood   though he wasn  t quite as bad in that film . the whole movie it feels like you  re watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities . it  s like he sits in his little director  s chair and thinks  how would a great filmmaker handle this scene   he just doesn  t have it in him . i don  t know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker . there were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished  but nothing was brought to ripen . the scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history . one by one as we see the characters singing  and i squirmed in my seat  i kept saying  please  please  just don  t have the guy on the brink of death singing  too   sure enough  massive failure
