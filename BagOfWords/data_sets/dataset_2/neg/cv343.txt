  cia codenamealexa  is an absolute horrible rip off of luc besson  s classic film  la femme nikita        . the film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the cia and is forced to do a secret mission for them .  pretty much the same story structure of la femme nikita  the acting combo of lorenzo lamas and o . j . simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history . lamas   acting  is simply a bad steven segal impersonation . watching orenthal act in this film is an excruciating experience .  br    br   the writing and acting is so poor in this film at times it is laughable . there are so many action movie  conventions  in the film it is ridiculous unnecessary car explosions  people flying thru glass windows  terrorists  bad ponytails  etc . the musical score resembles david michael frank  s score for  hard to kill         which furthers the steven segal theme of this movie . there is plenty of martial arts in the film  and it is pretty well done for a low budget american production . the mindless action and over the top acting never lets up  and i have to admit i was mildly entertained .  br    br   lorenzo lamas had the look of an action star back in the early    s but he is certainly no action star  that is why he is doing soap operas and not action blockbusters . my recommendation is that you skip  cia codenamealexa  and check out  la femme nikita  instead .
