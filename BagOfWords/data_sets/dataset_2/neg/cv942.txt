normally when i go on a raid of the local hollywood video i head towards the b  horror movies . to me the basic principals behind a b  horror movie is it  s camp value  heavy gore  lots of needless nudity  and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex . i rented cradle of fear strictly because i  ve been a fan of the band since they released they  re first demo in     . the movie started off on an interesting note and then when i saw dani filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask i laughed . when i saw the lesbian sex scene for the sake of a lesbian sex scene i laughed even harder . i spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when i wasn  t laughing i was shaking my head thinking about how a multi  million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi  hundreds of dollars . the whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the  hardcore goth kids who think death  destruction  sex  blood  and satan are the greatest things invented since lava lamps . that was really it . to me this movie seemed like   .   of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being satanic . this movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this  movie  really is just an extended cradle of filth video .
