this  film  is one of the most dreadful things i have ever seen .  br    br   please do yourselves a favor and avoid this incompetent concoction .  br    br   shaking the camera and having your actors adopt scowls does not count as  direction   which this film needed in droves . not that the writing was all the wonderful  rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way  the pseudo  documentary  style  prized by those who don  t know how to direct  .  br    br   this film gives the impression that it was done cynically to appeal to critics who don  t know the first thing about film  making  which is most of them  .  br    br   just terrible . it says a lot about sundance and what it  s become that victor vargas was showcased there .
