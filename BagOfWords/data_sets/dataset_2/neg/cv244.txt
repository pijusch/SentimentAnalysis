the movie started off strong  ll cool j  deed  as an undercover police officer  with partner sgt . lazerov  dylan mcdermott from the practice  possibly miscast as a bad guy   committing robbery and murder . deed refuses to kill the drug dealer  which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience . the other big names  freeman  spacey et al  are well cast and the movie shows promise .  br    br   the movie begins to fall short as soon as justin timberlake  pollack  is introduced . given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly  or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of timberlake  i would choose the former . even talented actors have to work hard at their craft timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him . i would have thought he would put on a better show  given the fact that he has been acting talented for years . everything he did in this film was unconvincing .  br    br   just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums  it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films . even hardcore n  sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent .  br    br   that aside there are a few plot holes  such as pollack  s sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery . this movie had so much promise . thoroughly disappointing .
