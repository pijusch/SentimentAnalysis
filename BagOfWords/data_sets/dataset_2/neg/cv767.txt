i argued with myself whether to rent this or not . i  m always afraid of renting something i  ve never heard of  don  t remember this being in theaters  . great cast . . . that  s what tipped the scales .   minutes in  i almost stopped watching it . the first few minutes are fun to watch  but unbelievable . it only gets worse after that . the writers of this movie could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their movies even a little better . or they could just try writing something just a little bit believable . i give it a  . . . . a  for the writing  only because there are words  and a  for being able to get so many good actors to agree to do this movie despite having to read the script . oh my god this movie sucks .
