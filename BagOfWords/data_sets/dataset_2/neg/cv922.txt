     will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray . first they sent us to eyes wide shut . then they hyped up the blair witch project and now magnolia which is by far the worst movie of the year . what is it about  who the heck knows . its full of self  indulgence and loaded with bad acting . i always like to stay and watch the credits  but when this thing was over i couldn  t get out of the movie theatre fast enough . most of the audience that attended the showing that i was at  felt pretty much the same way . dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers . it  s an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful .
