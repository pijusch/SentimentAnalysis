this film was so disappointing . from the blurb that made me decide to see phantom love  why is it called this   i had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery . it did have some interesting images but these often seemed random and made no sense . in fact they seemed like they were inserted to fill in time . in the end the effect was listless .  br    br   i believe the film was meant to be atmospheric  but it just wasn  t . the lack of a coherent plot did not help matters . you might say it was mysterious  but i think it was just incoherent with no atmosphere .  br    br   the main character seemed to be disturbed but the plot did not draw me in enough to care about her situation . without looking at the cast list i would not have known that you see the main character as a child . the film has very little context for the time  place or character . i am not a prude but the sex scenes  there were several  seemed pointless and confused me further  i recognised lulu but i was not sure if it was the same man  different men  a lover  her husband or was she a prostitute . it was only when i saw the credits that i discovered the hairy back was meant to belong to her lover . this film did manage to make what should have been shocking  dream sequences involving lulu  s mother  seem a bit boring .  br    br   the nail filing actually made more sense  as it did give some indication of lulu  s emotional state . i will not fault the actors as i don  t they had a lot to work on .  br    br   i do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was because of ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was dull .  br    br   i can  t be bothered talking about it anymore .
