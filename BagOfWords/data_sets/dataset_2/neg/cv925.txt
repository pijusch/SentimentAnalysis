i wanted to like magnolia . the plot reminded me of grand canyon  which i liked  .  different lives  stories that come together at the end but magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and i was lost . i almost turned it off right then and there but i felt i should hang in there until the end  little did i know it would be another torturous     hours . thank god i rented instead of seeing it in the theatre . i almost screamed out in frustration after  hours . the biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene . my dvd player still hasn  t forgiven me and i don  t blame it one bit . it was a unique movie  but a bad  boring  and pointless movie .
