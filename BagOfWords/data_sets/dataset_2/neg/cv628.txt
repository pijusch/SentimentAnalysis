while i count myself as a fan of the babylon  television series  the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start . although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there  the pace of the gathering is slow  the makeup somewhat inadequate  and the plot confusing . worse  the characterization in the premiere episode is poor . although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems  i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series .
