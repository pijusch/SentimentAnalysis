the first half of this version was the best i  ve seen  and i think i  ve seen every version of jane eyre ever made  . the development of jane  s childhood and character were exceptional . then  it was as though someone said  uh oh  this is running too long   and hacked the rest of the story to shreds . the major scenes  when included at all  are glossed over  combined  and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline . there was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow . the big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope  and then the end dashed it .
