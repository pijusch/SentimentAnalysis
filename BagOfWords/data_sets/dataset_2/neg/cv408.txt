this  movie  is such a bad work  nothing seems to even try and be realistic . plot is weak  acting  miserable  actors wondering around like in a  st year production  trying very hard to act with no chance at all from the beginning . what a flop  what a waste of time  money and effort to all concerned including the audience . well  as in any thriller  here too are murders  corpses and blood . just imagine someone who  minutes ago  committed a murder with a knife  and came out calm and smiling  not to mention clean as a whistle  as if slashing one  s throat is done by a virtual agent . also  this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male  and she cut his throat    did she ask him  politely  to bend down for her  much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one . continuity is another huge problem as for instance the eager  hungry groom is lying in bed  waiting for his virgin  bride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while  falls asleep      . next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception  area  asking for guidance to scenery spots  not a word about last night    such a waste of time even to try and write about this low  low supposed  to  be  movie  .
