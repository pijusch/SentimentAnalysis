a typical lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify lanza  s mgm contract at the time .  br    br   as reported by member lastliberal  above  grayson could not stand lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off  and sometimes on  camera . in addition  his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable . after doing their second  and last  film together   toast of new orleans   the normally quiet grayson stormed into louie b . mayer  s office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with lanza again  period . mayer felt that grayson was much more valuable to mgm then lanza  so grayson  s statement stuck . grayson went on to star in a number of widely received  and far more profitable  musicals with howard keel and others . later in life when asked to compare lanza and keel her reply was that there was no comparison between them  and that keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the  real people  in the audiences .
