it had all the clichs of movies of this type and no substance . the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it . the production was good however  the script and acting were b  movie quality . the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors . the good actors didn  t hold their own nor did they lift up the others .  br    br   this movie is not worthy of more words  but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines . james wood and cuba gooding  jr . play caricatures of themselves in other movies .  br    br   if you are looking for mindless entertainment  i still wouldn  t recommend this movie .
