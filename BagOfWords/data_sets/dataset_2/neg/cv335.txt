it a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an asian background does not even show one asian or african person  not even as an extra . that fact probably describes norwegian race relations in general .  however .  br    br   no spoilers  only a brief introductory description  br    br   buddy portrays four young people living in a flat  share in oslo . the protagonist are two young men that don  t manage to direct their life in any serious fashion  and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility  a sort of fear of growing up . the narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models . quite the clich . although the story is mildly funny  the acting is good and as a  young person  one can sort of identify with the characters crazy  situations and complicated love affairs  i don  t find the story or the characters very believable . to polished and lacking in depth . this film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as friends   yes that show on tv  .  br    br   has norwegian film finally found its identity   audience pleasers in well known american style .  br    br   how about watching lukas moodysson  s tillsammans  together  .
