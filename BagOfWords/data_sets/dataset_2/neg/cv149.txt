steven seagal movies have never been oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse .  br    br   this one starts with seagal getting picked up by the fbi because he killed a few people  in self defence  he  s active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen stealth plane that will be used by the clich  evil english villain  that hollywood is so obsessed with including these days .  br    br   suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent . the story isn  t interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story  characters of movie as a whole such as the  lesbian  interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isn  t even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didn  t need to .  br    br   in short a terrible script with bad dialog  delivered by sub  par actors  boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes  and non  relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near  impossible and make the movie even worse .  br    br   save   minutes of your life and give this miss  even if you are seagal  s most ardent fan .
