this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life   it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous   and i have never seen such bad acting in my life  the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys  especially drew fuller  . i don  t know what these people were thinking when they made this movie   i didn  t even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves . i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn  i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch  i was very disappointed   the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion .
