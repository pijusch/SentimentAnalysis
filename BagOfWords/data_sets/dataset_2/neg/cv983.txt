i just watched the convent for the second time . i had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken friday night film  some gore  some style  bit of humour and suchlike . i was saddened to find that i could no longer appreciate it much . it seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like night of the demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile . for the record i  m not even a huge fan of night of the demons  but there were some things i really dug about it . the convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much . apart from the main girl  likeable performance from joanna canton   the goth girl and a sweet cameo from adrienne barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable  festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic  offensive jockhood . the film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that  given the awful dialogue  it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film . the evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes  though not scary their certainly kinda cool  and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore . towards the end  when adrienne barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy . the stylised direction also occasionally yields good results  although sometimes the camera just moves too fast . all in all  this was a film where for me the shining good points just can  t make up for the things i hated . those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more  but for me it wasn  t a good time .
