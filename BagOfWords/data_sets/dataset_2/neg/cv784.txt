wow and i thought that any steven segal movie was bad . every time i thought that the movie couldn  t get worse it proved me wrong . the story was good but the actors couldn  t carry it off . also  they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done . for instance you don  t handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for . the biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl . she is a weak actress and i felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was . the whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me . i like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff  so that almost seemed depressing . i thought that the characters wern  t explained well enough . you didn  t find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them .
