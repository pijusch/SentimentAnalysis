i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the     s in this beautiful film . the story is simple . an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children . the faces of the actors are marvelous to see . the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well . the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine  which was more sophisticated and intricate . the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel . the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism  humanity  and history portrayed .
