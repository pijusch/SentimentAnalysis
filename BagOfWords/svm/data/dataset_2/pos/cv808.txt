the perfect space fantasy film . a group of kids go up accidentally in space and have to get back down  but do they  sure they do . this would not be a family film if they all died . then it will all be sad . you don  t want that kate capsaw  the leading lady gives a golden globe performance  but sadly  she nor lea thompson won one . that sucks so bad . i can  t say it enough  this film is so great  lea thompson  o lord  a perfect girl for this film . this film is the best for sure .  br    br   sorry  but better than star wars . star wars is so over  rated and space camp was so under  rated . it should of been the other way around  br    br   excellent        r maybe      . iam not good at math
