i turned this on to see the incredible ethel waters  whose autobiography i am now reading . i  ll admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in  but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece . it  s pretty much a short film made by blacks  for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes to the people involved were the jokes of their time  old trends exaggerated for humor . we see modern black movies do the same thing  but with the new trends  stereotypes    ho  s  and the  hood  and such . i think if you look back in eighty years  you would find today  s movies will look just as racist . what viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of waters and the pint  sized sammy davis jr .  who out taps his contemporary  shirley temple  and looks remarkably the same facially as he did as an adult . everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it . why not enjoy it for what it is  instead of what you think it should have been
