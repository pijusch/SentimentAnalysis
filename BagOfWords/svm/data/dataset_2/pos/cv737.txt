does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film  i love it  one of my top   films of all time . it just makes me feel good . i watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over    bebe benson  michelle johnston  is the babe of the film  imho  i never saw the play but i get angry when i read reviews that say the play was better than the film . the two are like apples and oranges . the film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work . i believe it  s only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen aren  t changed more than they are . this is a very good film  it is very satisfying . that  s all you need to know
