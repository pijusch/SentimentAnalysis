i found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the get  go . when miss stanwyck starts her narration it  s only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming . the deserted area  the lock on the deserted gas station door  everything sets you up to wait for it . . . here it comes . at first you think it will be about the little boy  but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in . i found this movie to be really stressful  even though i had watched it before and was prepared for the denouement . now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating  maybe a white knuckles award
