what would you expect from a film titled  surviving christmas  and presented as  festive fun   something like ghandi or english patient  there are lots of things i love about this film  it  s funny  it is very well cast and it is superbly written . i came to the film as a kaplan  elfort fan but was dubious when i read the plot  it sounded ridiculous . but the film doesn  t come across like that because affleck  as drew latham  plays his part perfectly  one minute a child  like adult  the next a mature man who realises he has gained everything in life apart from what he really wants . in fact we see latham grow up in this film  when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realises that their lives are not so good  he sees that his own lot is not so bad .  br    br   this film has fewer weak or dud scenes than many other comedies i have seen . comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama  it either works or it doesn  t and very few comedy writers get it correct every time . i particularly loved the drama scene  where the family take to reading parts written by latham . the pleasure is in the reaction of tom valco  james gandolfini  and the comments of brian valco  josh zuckerman  . it is the dilemma of the greedy tom valco who has to bite his tongue  wear silly hats or sing to the christmas tree in order to earn the prize money that keeps the film moving along well .  br    br   the addition of daughter alicia  christina applegate  into the story brings a delightful romantic angle  and why not in a christmas film  of course its corny and contrived he  s rich and handsome  she  s beautiful and single  and so inevitably her and afflect end up falling over together in the snow and finding themselves face to face . great  one thing i would have liked was more use of festive music to boost the atmosphere but i can  t really complain . i got what i wanted .
