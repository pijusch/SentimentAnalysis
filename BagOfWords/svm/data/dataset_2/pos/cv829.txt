gdon and jules naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie new york city firefighters . what they got was the only film footage inside the world trade center on september   .  br    br   having worked with james hanlon  s ladder company before  jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak  while gdon stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened . an airplane flying low over the city distracted jules  and he pointed the camera up  seconds before the plane crashed into tower one .  br    br   jules asked the captain to follow him into the towers . the first thing he saw was two people on fire  something he refused to film . he stayed on site for the next several hours  filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were there .  br    br   the brothers naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent  grizzly  and gory . but the language from the firefighters is a little coarse  and cbs showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored . the brothers naudet mixed footage they filmed with one  on  one interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis .  br    br   unlike a feature film of similar title  most of the money from dvd sales go to      related charities . very well made  emotional  moving  and completely devoid of political propaganda  is the best documentary of the sort to date .
