good  funny  straightforward story  excellent nicole kidman  i almost always like the movies she  s in  . this was a good  vehicle  for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both . a romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories  great closing lines . chaplin  very good here  was also good in another good  but unpopular romantic comedy   truth about cats  dogs   . maybe they  re too implausible . ebert didn  t even post a review for this . the great  screwball  comedies obviously were totally implausible   bringing up baby   etc .  . if you  ve seen one implausible comedy  you  ve seen them all  or maybe people are ready to move on from the     s . weird . birthday girl is a movie i  ve enjoyed several times . nicole kidman may be the  killer app  for home video .
