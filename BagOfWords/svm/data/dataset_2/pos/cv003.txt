this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon . sure  its flawed . it does not give a realistic view of homelessness  unlike  say  how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers  or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots  . many of the jokes fall flat . but still  this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not  and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive . its not the fisher king  but its not crap  either . my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead  i love mel as a director and writer  not so much as a lead  .
