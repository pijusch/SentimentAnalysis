i have to say  from the beginning  when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasn  t blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie  with a lot of potential  though the movie wasn  t as  erm  amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens  which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing  even though i  m not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people  i don  t remember one line from either of those movies  i  m not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts  in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you  ah getting slightly off the point here  well my point is that the that you don  t have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series  which unfortunately ended after   amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end  in     .  br    br   though i didn  t like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in      and let me tell you  the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series  the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects  were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today . i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasn  t for stargate  and my dad  who actually got me into sci fi when i was like   and i  m glad he did  other wise i wouldn  t have seen the brilliant shows like sg   which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies  basically if a new sci fi series isn  t better or as good as sg   its not worth watching . basically this is the best sci fi show to date  and if you don  t watch this  then you have no idea what you are missing
