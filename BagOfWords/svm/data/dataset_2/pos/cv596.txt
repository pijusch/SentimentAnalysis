this movie was very funny  i couldn  t stop smiling when watching this and have already watched it twice in a period of  days  the movie is distinctively unique in it  s humor and visuals  both are terrific and on par with natali  s other  more serious  movie gems cube and cypher . i have become a huge vincenzo natali fan ever since watching cypher and everything he  s made is very interesting .  br    br   very likable about this movie are the music and  loser  characters dave and andrew  portrayed by david hewlett and andrew miller  co  writer of the story   actors i both like very much . also cool are the x  box dead or alive fights  you even see dave playing halo at a point  and andrew  s amazing guitar solo  among many other things .  br    br   all in all a great feel  good film about friendship . you have to see this
