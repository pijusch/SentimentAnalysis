you know  robin williams  god bless him  is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade  with perhaps the exception of  death to smoochy   which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic  . the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic  especially  insomnia  and  one hour photo  .  the night listener   despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release  is among his best work  period .  br    br   this is a very chilling story  even though it doesn  t include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter . the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed . in high school  i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson  who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result . i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist . when i saw this movie  the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind .  br    br   toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic  caretaker  . her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like  little miss sunshine  . there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me . it takes a good actress to play that sort of role  and it  s this understated  yet well reviewed  role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award  as of      . it  s incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this  and it  s scary too .  br    br   this is a good  dark film that i highly recommend . be prepared to be unsettled  though  because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end .
