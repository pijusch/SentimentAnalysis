this would have worked a lot better if it had been made as  mitchell in malta .  at least then we would have been spared the sight of joe don baker running around an otherwise scenic mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit . . . not to mention acting like an old west gunslinger . mitchell being mitchell  the film wouldn  t have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either . oh well . at least the comic comments of mike and the bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of mst . i can  t imagine watching it on it  s own  however .
