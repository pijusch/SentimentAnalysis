i must confess that i was completely shocked by this film . for one  i went to see it on a whim expecting something mediocre  but given this  the most shocking thing was that this was in a populist american cinema at all . this is british comedy at its finest  dark  quirky and funny in ways that american films just never are . i must stop short  however  of recommending this wholeheartedly to anyone i went to see it with several people  some english  some european and some american and while some of us loved it  mainly from the first two groups   some hated it and found it worthless . if you think you  re into this kind of thing then go . if not  don  t .      .
