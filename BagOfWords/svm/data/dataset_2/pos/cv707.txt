harem suare is the best film i saw in the year     . bravo ferzan ozpetek . sensually shot and stunningly portrayed  harem suare is a bold film that tackles interracial romance  which is such a taboo in hollywood . women of all shapes  sizes  and color  populate the film . cut off from the outside world  the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue  rivalry and jealousies within their ranks .
