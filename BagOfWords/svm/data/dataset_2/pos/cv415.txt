i just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced   mins of roll .  br    br   roll is about a country boy  mat  toby malone  who has dreams of becoming a sports star . mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin george  damien robertson  . well  that was the plan anyway . george is involved with a gangster  tiny  john batchelor  and is making a delivery for him . needless to say  mat gets dragged into george  s world .  br    br   i thought it was great how mat teaches george some morals and respect while george teaches mat how to relax and enjoy life a little . toby and damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job .  br    br   every character in the movie complimented each other very well  the two cops were great . david ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie . tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters  pando  from two hands .  br    br   one of the other things that i liked about roll was that it showcased the cities that i grew up and lived in for   years  perth and fremantle . it was good to see sights and landmarks that i grew up with  especially the old ferris wheel .  br    br   this rocks  n  rolls
