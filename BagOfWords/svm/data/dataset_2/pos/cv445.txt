probably the finest fantasy film ever made . sumptuous colour  spectacular sets  incredible  spot  on miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood . acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands  but here the poetic dialog is deftly  sensitively spoken  the humour is subtle and delightful as well  .  br    br   doubtless spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one . along with  the four feathers         one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london films    and one of the finest motion pictures ever made .  br    br   a true  compelling classic
