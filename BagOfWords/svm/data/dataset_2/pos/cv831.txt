i rented this for my son who is recently found interest in     . he was a kindergartener at the time and had no idea what was unfolding . i liked the way it was told as a  documentary .  if there was one movie that i would recommend to see concerning      this would be the one  normally you see a movie it has actors that are well known . this movie had nobody known . also  you see a movie concerning      you hear about a fire  fighter or two losing their lives saving people . i didn  t feel this had any of that  i only rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection  very well done indeed  my heart goes out to the survivors and families of victims of
