i think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words  clueless and appalling nonsense .  i think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment . one has to suspend one  s disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love  have a child and live together happily ever after . but it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have one  s heart warmed . is it so impossible  there are far more implausible events described in other movies . the acting is good  the script is funny . the only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of extending on to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality .
