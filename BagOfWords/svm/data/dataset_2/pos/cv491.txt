this is truly truly one of the best movies about love that i  ve ever seen . closely followed by none other than  before sunset   which technically isn  t another movie at all  since it  s about the same two people and the same romance .  br    br   this is  love  in the real world . ok  that  s only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie . reading the other reviews  it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialog  based movies as well . and this is what makes  before sunrise  so good . the dialog is perfect . it  s so real  so engaging and funny . it  s hardly a surprise that jesse and celine fall in love   coz you fall in love with them at the very same time .  br    br   my favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop  where they pretend to phone their best friends  with the other pretending to be said best friend . it  s perfect . brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life .  br    br   i must say that if you have a choice  do watch  before sunrise  before watching  before sunset  . if like me  you watched  sunset  first  it  s hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show .  br    br   once again  the greatest romantic movie in my books . wonderful acting  excellent script  and beautiful locations . young love  at it  s best .
