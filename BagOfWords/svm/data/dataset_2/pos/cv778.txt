this is a comedy based on national stereotypes  no doubt . if you leave away pretending you know or you care what communism was about and how real russians or brits are  if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions  you can have fun with this film . nicole kidman is at her best  sexy  moving and funny . ben chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out  shadowed by nicole  and the rest of the cast does good work as well . the final is moving  and logical  movie logics  of course . worth watching  if you accept the rules of the game .
