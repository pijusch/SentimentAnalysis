plenty has been written about mamet  s  the house of games   most of it good . i decided to revisit the flick to see how it held up after   years and was surprised at how much i enjoyed viewing it again . the film  s success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film a good story and a good scam . mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us  the audience  and the mark simultaneously . then he explains the art of conning only to do it again  etc . all the while building the story .  the house of games   now a freebie on cable  is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for mamet fans .  b
