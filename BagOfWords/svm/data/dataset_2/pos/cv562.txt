rated e  br    br   i never actually owned a nintendo   but i have played one many times . in my opinion along with conkers bad fur day  super mario   is one of the best video games for the nintendo   system . i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time . if you have an n   and don  t have this game you should try to find it . the original super mario bros games were side scrolling video games but super mario   has a  d mario in a nice  d environment . the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game . you play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the    power stars from bowzer . now you can do it in a  d environment . super mario   is a very fun and good n   game and i recommend it .  br    br
