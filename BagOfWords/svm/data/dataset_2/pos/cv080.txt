an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this film .  br    br   shameful since it warrants having a wider audience .  br    br   a wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told  although admittedly predictable in its resolution . solidly acted by the principals . beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film .  br    br   my recent foray into chinese film  shower  the road home  not one less  has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring . china and its people is an amazing canvas for film  makers .  the king of masks  can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese film .  br    br
