this movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about murphy  s law being applied to home ownership and construction . if a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional . since it was set in the  simpler  forties  we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era . grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by loy and douglas . their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment      .
