sure  titanic was a good movie  the first time you see it  but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change . the first time you see the movie you see the underlying love  story and think ooh  how romantic . the second time  and i am not the only one to think this  it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking  when is this dn ship going to sink    and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times . the acting in this film is not bad  but definetly not great either . was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film  i mean who does he think he is  anthony hopkins or denzel washington  he does  half  good movie and won  t do a film for less than    million . and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it . but enough about  in my eyes  the worst character of the film . kate winslet  s performance on the other hand was wonderful . i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together . there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many love  stories as it is  filmmakers shouldn  t try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie    out of a possible     i give this film a mere    .
