this is perhaps the best rockumentary ever  a british  better this is spinal tap . the characters are believable  the plot is great  and you can genuinely empathise with some of the events  such as ray  s problem with fitting in the band .  br    br   the soundtrack is excellent . real period stuff  even if it is in the same key  you  ll be humming some of the songs for days . what i liked was the nearly all  british cast  with some of the favourite household names . ray  s wife is priceless . . .  br    br   the film never drags  it just goes at the right pace  and has some genuinely funny sections in it . a generator of some really good catchphrases   br    br   it  s a hidden diamond .
