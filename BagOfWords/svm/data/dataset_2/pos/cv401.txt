once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they . . . somehow . . . managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended  you  ll find that it  s not half bad . the plot is engaging and interesting  and the pacing is fast  with this covering many situations  and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken . where this really stands out is the acting . the performances are excellent . neill and streep are both impeccable . it  s also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film  and even those who don  t come naturally to it at least attempt an accent . the cinematography and editing are nice enough  but they don  t really go beyond the standard stuff . this movie  s story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling . while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture  i understand that it is quite close to the truth . there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this . it is  at times  a downright great courtroom drama . i recommend this to any fellow fan of such .
