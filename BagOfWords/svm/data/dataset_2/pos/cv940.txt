i  m   years old  a guitarist   lead  rhythm   and over the last forty years  i  ve been in four bands  it  s all there  the fights  the foul  ups  the rotten food  the worse accommodation  always travelling  little or no money  and every one was drunk or high . but  the clubs  the fans  and the music  made it all worth it  just like strange fruit  i  m too damn old for it now  and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking  but for the length of that video  it all came back  and it was all there  the birds  the brawls  and the booze  and i was young again  it  s just like billy connolly  s voice over  god likes that    s stuff  rock on forever
