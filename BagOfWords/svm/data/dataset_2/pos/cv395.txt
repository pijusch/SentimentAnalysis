in august     the disappearance of baby azaria chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation . the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood . what followed was a gross miscarriage of justice .  br    br   michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near ayers rock  central australia  that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area . no  one believed them . lindy was charged with the murder of her baby  and michael as an accessory after the fact . the whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing . the chamberlain  s trial was over before it began .  br    br   lindy never proved her innocence  so she was found guilty . there was never enough evidence to convict her  yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure . how could we as a nation even sit in judgement  from where we are  how could we possibly presume to know  unless there was absolute proof  and no reasonable doubt whatsoever  the chamberlains should have been acquitted .  br    br   fred schepisi  s film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of john bryson  s novel  that the chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them . that in fact a dingo did take baby azaria on that fateful night at ayers rock .  br    br   schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation  hell bent on  the truth  being brought to light . he shows australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the chamberlains pay  his screenplay  co  written with robert caswell  vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred .  br    br   the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts . she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight . even her accent is almost  but not quite  spot on . a very good effort by the master of that trade . sam neill is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart  and he starts to question his christianity . his  as was streep  s  is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly . the entire support cast are also excellent  with some of australia  s finest actors and actresses playing a part .  br    br   technically the film is brilliant too  with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour  especially the rock  . editor jill bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged  while bruce smeaton provides a telling score .  br    br   for all aussies this is a must see  a shocking look in the mirror if you will  at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served  and the truth to be known . as michael chamberlain said   i don  t think anybody really understands what innocence means . . . . . to innocent people .   br    br   saturday  may         video  br    br   even on return viewings fred schepisi  s account of the travesty of justice that befell the chamberlains  who lost baby azaria at ayres rock in      is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving .  br    br   schepisi and robert caswell have expertly transferred john bryson  s novel to the screen  telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain  whose new born daughter azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down .  br    br   amid media speculation and vicious public rumour lindy was charged with the murder of her baby  and michael was charged as an accessory after the fact . what followed was little more than trial by media  and with the australian people determined she be put away  lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour  even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence .  br    br   meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence . she is truly awesome  and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent  though she does her level best to sound ocker . you might wonder why a top australian actress wasn  t cast in the role  but star power is probably the answer . alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam neill  outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes  while he feels powerless to do anything about it . a strong aussie cast lend compelling support .  br    br   editing from jill bilcock is very timely  ian baker  s cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce smeaton  s music is perfect for the part . truly a must for all conscientious australians .  br    br
