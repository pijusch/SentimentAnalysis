i initially bought this dvd because it had srk and aishwarya rai on the cover and i thought  hey  another film starring aishu and shah rukh  little did i know that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with srk and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just   minutes . shakti is a film about a mother  s love and endurance . it  s a film about transformations  ignorance  coming of age  stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life . the item number in which srk and aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie . it  s actually a dream sequence that occurs while srk  s drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze . he dreams that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day  dressed scantily and begins to seduce him . the title of the song is  ishq kamina   loosely translated as  love  s a bitch    and it is just plain smoking hot  don  t miss it .
