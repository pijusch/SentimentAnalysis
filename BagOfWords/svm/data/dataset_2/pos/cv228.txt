rented this one accidentally  it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting  didn  t find out until i got home  watched it anyways . absolutely fantastic  a wonderful movie  and one of my top three favorite of all time  i recommend it to everyone   br    br   the story is enjoyable and easy to follow  this could have been easily messed up  but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it together .  br    br   the actors themselves are fantastic  displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job .  br    br   gotta find a copy somewhere . . . . . . . . . . .
