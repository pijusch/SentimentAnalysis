i haven  t written a review on imdb for the longest time  however  i felt myself compelled to write this  when looking up this movie i found one particular review which urged people not to see this film . do not pay any attention to this ignorant person  nothing is a fantastic film  full of laughs and above all . . . imagination  aren  t you sick and tired of being force fed the same old cycle of bubble  gum trash movies  sometimes a film like nothing comes along and gives you something you have never seen before . i don  t even care if you dislike  even hate  the movie  but no one has a right to discredit the film . imdb has a monumental impact on reputations and no negative review should discredit the film like that . just say you hate it and why you hate it . . . but don  t try to tell people that they shouldn  t watch it . we have minds of our own and will make up our own minds thank you .  br    br   if my judgment is any good  i  d say that more people will enjoy this movie as opposed to those who hate it .  br    br   treat your mind to a bit of eye  candy  see nothing
