i saw it last night on tv  and was quite delighted .  br    br   it is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart  and believe that there is still some goodness in the world  all the neighbours pretended not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect her  the old policeman is my favourite   although you know that this story is not quite realistic .  br    br   i loved acting  they all seemed just as ordinary  common people  living in small picturesque english coast town  but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has  just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their  tea     br    br   perhaps the ending was a little bit confusing  but it didn  t stop me from really  really enjoying the whole story
