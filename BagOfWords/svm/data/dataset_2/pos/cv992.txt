i had some reservations about this movie  i figured it would be the usual bill of fare    a formula movie about christmas . being in the middle of a heat wave in late june  we decided to give it a shot anyway  maybe we would see some snow .  br    br   this movie turned out to be one laugh after another . ben affleck was believable in his character  but the real star of this one is james gandofini . he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great  dad  .  br    br   if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours  definitely check this one out .
