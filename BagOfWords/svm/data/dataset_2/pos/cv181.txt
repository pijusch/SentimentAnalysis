this had a good story . . . it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool .  br    br   i  ve watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one i  ve seen in the two weeks .  br    br   jason bigg  s character was the best though .  br    br   even though it was small  it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning .  br    br   this may be a romantic comedy and i don  t like most  but the writing  direction  performing  sound  design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool .  br    br   this film scored pretty high out of all the movie  s i  ve seen lately  and the rest were big budget or better publicized .  br    br   good job in writing .
