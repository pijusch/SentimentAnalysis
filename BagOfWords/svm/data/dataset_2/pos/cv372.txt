the only reason i give this movie an  out of   is because there are few movies  in my opinion  that are perfect . this little b picture is a taut story  well told . i  ve always been intrigued by alexander knox  but have seen him very few movies . here he plays wilhelm grimm  a sad little man who turns into a monster . he betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse . the performance is one of the most chilling performances i  ve ever seen . since world war   actors who played nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for oscars . i imagine that since this was made during the war  the academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil . but knox puts in that kind of performance   a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer . i still can  t get over it .  br    br   marsha hunt  who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly  is cast against type in probably the best performance i  ve ever seen her give  too . maybe not oscar worthy  but the best of her career . nothing against her i have enjoyed her in those  slight  roles she often played . but here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama .  br    br   if you like human drama stories  or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the nazis  i highly recommend this fine little film .
