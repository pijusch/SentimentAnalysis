i  m a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show . and i really enjoyed this flick . i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters .  br    br   it  s funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like  lame plot  and  it  s much cruder than the show .  does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode  daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage . the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot .  br    br   and as far as the plot goes . it was the perfect dukes plot . in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screen .  br    br   while sean william scott and johnny knoxville aren  t exactly like their small screen versions  they do a great job and work very well together . i wasn  t too keen on burt  s boss hogg though . and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe . in the movie roscoe is a little . . . scary .  br    br   and who didn  t have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard   br    br   folks  allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia  bikinis and car chases  you won  t be sorry . it  s just a great dumb movie
