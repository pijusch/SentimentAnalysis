in the spirit of the classic  the sting   this movie hits where it truly hurts . . . in the heart  a prim  proper female psychiatrist  hungry for adventure  meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals . the vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman  and begs to be involved in his operation . while the movie moves kind of  slow   it  s climax and ending are stunning  you  ll especially enjoy how the doctor  forgives herself
