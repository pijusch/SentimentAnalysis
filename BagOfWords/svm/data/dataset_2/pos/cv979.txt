this is not a bad movie . it follows the new conventions of modern horror  that is the movie within a movie  the well known actress running for her life in the first scene . this movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose  and manage to do something new  and interesting with it . it is also always nice to see molly ringwald back for the attack .  br    br   so this might be an example of what the genre has become . cut hits all the marks  and is actually scary in some parts . i liked it i gave it an eight .
