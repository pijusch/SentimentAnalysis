some films just simply should not be remade . this is one of them . in and of itself it is not a bad film . but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the     film of the same title . liam neeson was excellent as he always is  and most of the cast holds up  with the exception of owen wilson  who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke . but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it  s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects . again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film . but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more .
