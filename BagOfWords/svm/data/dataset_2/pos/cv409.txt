  a cry in the dark  is a masterful piece of cinema  haunting  and incredibly though provoking . the true story of lindy chamberland  who  in      witnessed a horrific sight  seeing her   month  old baby being brutally taken from their family  s tent  while camping on the austrailian outback . azaria  the baby  was never seen again  and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world . meryl streep does immaculate justice to the role of lindy  as she always does . but the one thing that helps  a cry in the dark  never fall flat is the brilliant direction . a truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case  tears are brought to the eyes . the concept is nothing less then terrifying  and afterwards you are left haunted  but also inspired .
