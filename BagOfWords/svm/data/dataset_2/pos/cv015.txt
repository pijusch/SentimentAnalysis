like one of the previous commenters said  this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery . such a waste because collette  s performance was eerie and williams was believable . i just kept waiting for it to get better . i don  t think it was bad editing or needed another director  it could have just been the film . it came across as a canadian movie  something like the first few seasons of x  files . not cheap  just hokey . also  it needed a little more suspense . something that makes you jump off your seat . the movie reached that moment then faded away kind of like a false climax . i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the  reality  of the story but i thought that part was reached when gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy . this movie needs to have a director  s cut that tries to fix these problems .
