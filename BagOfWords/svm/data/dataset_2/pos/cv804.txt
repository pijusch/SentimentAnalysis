this is one of those feel good  saturday afternoon movies . it  s right up there with other retro flicks like flight of the navigator . just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up . and it  s fun to see how   years has changed the stars like kelly preston and lea thompson . not to mention joquin phoenix .  br    br   i personally really like movies like this from time to time . nothing too deep or too scary . just a nice story line . and i would have never known mr . phoenix had i not recently read the credits . he was just a baby really when he made this movie .  br    br   kelly preston was quite the young budding actress then too . she and lea did a wonderful job in this movie . i agree it  s not an oscar caliber movie . but very much worth watching . especially if you have kids in the  let  s say   to   year old range . or ones that are interested in the space program .
