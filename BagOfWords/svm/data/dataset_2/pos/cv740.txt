i watched this movie after seeing it on broadway . i love the broadway musical and i love the movie . i watched the movie like it was not related to the broadway show . i am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies  so i developed a philosophy really early . assume that the movie is going to be based on the book  or musical in this case  but that while the story line may be similar it will not be the same  it will be different so watch it for what it is .  br    br   i danced for   years before i had to make a choice . i was a good dancer  picking up chorus work in local productions as a child etc  but i wasn  t super talented . i was however super talented as a show rider . i was told by my dance instructor and my trainer  who i spent several months a year at his farm out of state  that i had to make a choice when i turned   . that i needed to move up from dancing two hours four  five days a week and riding  hours a day  days a week . . and dedicate to one or the other . so i dearly love dancing and i love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies . i just chose to watch this movie for what it is  it is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction . it is about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work really hard to get something you want and you just do not get it . i love the movie . i love the broadway musical .
