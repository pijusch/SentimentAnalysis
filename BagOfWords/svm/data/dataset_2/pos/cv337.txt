bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan  an average man who feels god is messing up his life . god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways . of course  giving someone god  s powers could take a turn for the worse . bruce almighty is a good comedy  jim carrey is good  as always morgan freeman is first  rate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well . the jokes are almost always on target  although sometimes they resort a bit too much on carrey  s facial expressions . i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god  not only that but also as a black man . i thought this quite well  especially with the brilliant freeman . there are some hilarious scenes  the opening cookie scene for instance  others miss the target slightly but still a good film .    out of
