it took us a couple of episodes to  get into  dark angel as a story and a series  since we were transitioning from the sopranos  a very different mentality framework . but  once we got with the gist of the series  we were very quickly hooked . it  s a shame that the series ended just when it was just starting to past good into the excellent category dark angelwas much more than your average tv series . it kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes  but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to  mutants  reminds us of the constant prejudices that we face  and make  everyday . that the story is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the anti  discrimination message from being rubbed in our faces  hence not ruining the  fun  for those who don  t like to be lectured during entertainment   but every event and human  societal interaction remains relevant to the present . we all make judgments  face our own prejudices  but  in the end  the question of who you are lies in do you sit back and shut your mind to it  or do you get up and do something about it  for those who have no choice but to fight  for survival or justice  this series empowers them . for those who  ve never had to face the question  this series  sneaks in  that message under the guise of pure action entertainment . it is much more well  made and well  written than most tv series i  m highly disappointed it ended before it could really kick into high gear .
