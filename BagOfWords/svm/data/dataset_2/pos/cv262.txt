hello dave burning paradise is a film for anyone who likes jackie chan and indiana jones . the films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers . as for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes . where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional hong kong movie style with the hollywood action adventure . sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in hollywood .
