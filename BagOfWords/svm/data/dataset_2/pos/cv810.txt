i would like to comment the series as a great effort . the story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well  especially in season  . season  however became more of a freak show  and lost da  s original charm . season one story line was more interesting  a light side to the life at jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the x  series . i was looking forward to new seasons  in fact i still am . i hope the fox guys and da production crew realize that a lot of ppl still wait for da to make a comeback . even after  yrs of it being cancelled  da can make it big if worked on properly  and i think a name like james cameron should take on this challenge .
