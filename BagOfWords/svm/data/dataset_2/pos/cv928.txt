i thought this movie was fantastic . it was hilarious . kinda reminded me of spinal tap . this is a must see for any fan of    s rock .  i hope me and my friends aren  t like that in twenty years    br    br   bill nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit   br    br   stephen rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together  but not succeeding well .  br    br   if you love music  and were ever in a band  this movie is definitely for you . you won  t regret seeing this movie . i know i don  t . even my family found it funny  and that  s saying something .
