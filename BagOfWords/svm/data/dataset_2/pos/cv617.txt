i wasn  t sure what to expect but am i glad i went to see this . a smart  slightly twisted comedy that makes you think . i wasn  t quite sure how a director can create  nothing   but leave it to mr . natali and the brilliant individuals at c . o . r . e . to create another low budget set that looks real  as real as nothing can be  . well worth your time and money  if you have the opportunity to see this  please go . you  ll be glad you did .
