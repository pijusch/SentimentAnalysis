first let me say that before sunrise  like all movies  is not a movie for all tastes . it appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact  but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people . for me  like most folks here  before sunrise struck a deep chord in me  i was truly stunned  moved  inspired by it . this is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing . it creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine . it is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings i got from it .  br    br   the movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other . it is very intelligent and inspiring  not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of jesse and celine  s discussions  but rather the little nuances  the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other . it captures an honest  romantic  yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime viennese milieu it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world . and what happens after that night is open for debate  but i never doubt that they won  t each other again .  br    br   the facile comments by rockythebear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie .  br    br   see it and it may change your way of life .
