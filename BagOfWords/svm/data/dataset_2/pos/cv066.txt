verhoeven  s movie was utter and complete garbage . he  s a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed . by his own admission  he read  chapters of the book  got bored  and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch .  br    br   heinlein would have never supported that trash if he  d been alive to see it . it basically steals the name  mocks politics of the book  which is a good portion of it   and throws in some ta so the average idiot american moviegoer doesn  t get bored .  br    br   this anime isn  t perfect  but it  s at least mostly accurate  as best i can tell .
