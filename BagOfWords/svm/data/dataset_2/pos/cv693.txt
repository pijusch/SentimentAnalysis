i thought i should qualify my position after reading other reviews . the movie is not great  but it has a lot of great elements . the lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great . the story is slow and weak  but entertaining . the acting is bad  but no worse than you will find on the syfy channel . the music is pretty good and the gore is good . it has the great leather face in the film and is produced by bruce campbell . i watched the complete movie and while mostly predictable  it was still enjoyable . the women are attractive enough and the lead actor does a good job of being brooding and creepy . the movie was remarkably clean for a modern film and the violence appropriate for children   and up . there was no sex scenes . i gave it  out of   and i think that is fair . i would watch it again if i had nothing better to do . the gay sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film  the devil is quite creepy .
