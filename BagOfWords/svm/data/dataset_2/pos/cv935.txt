so i rented  still crazy  instead . when i described hardcore logo to the guy at the video store  he said that sounded kind of like still crazy . so i rented it . was i disappointed  well  yes  as still crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band  but that  s ok . still crazy tells the story of the strange fruit  a rock band that broke up in the   s at the peak of their popularity at a large rock festival . twenty years later  the band members are all struggling to make a living  and are offered the opportunity to play a concert at the twenty year anniversary of this festival . they take up the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis  touring europe in the process . some quite funny hijinks ensue  and all the characters go through subtle changes . watching this movie  you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant . and that  s not bad at all .
