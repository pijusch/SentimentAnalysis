unfortunately  spacecamp came out about the same time as the challenger explosion . which really put a crimp on when to bring it out or even if they should  bring it out . i  m glad they did . i first watched spacecamp at a drive  in movie . which really enhanced the viewing a lot .  br    br   while i had heard of lea thompson and tom skerritt . i had never heard of the others in the movie . so  it came as a big shock to me to find all those youngsters acting  and acting real good  of course  kate capshaw was excellent too .  br    br   i especially liked the scenes  where those kids were being shown how to act  as a team . the scenes of the kids being prepared for a trip they could only hope for . the actual launch of a spacecraft  is of course  old news to us . however  this one was different .  br    br   all in all  this is one of my most treasured films . escapist maybe  but it was fantastic for a space nut like me . after probably renting it for      times . i finally found it available in a certain store and bought it . now  if it only comes out on dvd . i will probably have it forever . this movie gets a  out of   from me .
