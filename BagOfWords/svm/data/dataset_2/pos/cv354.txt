having read many of the other reviews for this film on the imdb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based . upon this point i cannot comment  having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously . however  what i can say with certainty  is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass let  s be honest here  this film is just so much fun   br    br   ok . . so i must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character  s but let  s put this into a clear perspective . . do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic      s batman series does not remain faithful to the original dc comic book character  or perhaps is there still unrest in same persons that the     film version of flash gordon was too much of a departure from the original series   br    br   the point is  yes this film is incredibly camp but that  s precisely its charm   br    br   former tarzan  ron ely plays the eponymous hero in this  and bears more than a passing resemblance to gary busey to boot   and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles . also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite michael berryman .  br    br   best scene  far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke  lemonade and milk at a formal occasion  also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein savage tackles his nemesis captain seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen   priceless   br    br   simply put  the film doesn  t take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it . great fun from start to finish   and you  ll be singing the john phillip sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed
