i enjoyed still crazy more than any film i have seen in years . a successful band from the    s decide to give it another try . they start by playing some gigs in some seedy european venues  with hilarious results . the music is fantastic  the script and acting are terrific . the characters are spot on  especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice  makeup and personality problems . the concert at the end was unreal . go and see it  preferably in a cinema with a good sound system
