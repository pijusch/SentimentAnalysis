if you have any clue about jane austens production  youll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels marriage  marriage and marriage  in my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring  but i like austens characters  because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in emma . the thing that makes emma good is gwyneth paltrow  shes very good in her leading role . also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie dont seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious .
