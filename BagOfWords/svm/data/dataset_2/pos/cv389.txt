i believe they were telling the truth the whole time . . u cant trust anything in the wild . . . they family went through hell . those poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them . but still having to deal with the rumours . as well as dealing with the lose of their little sister . i cant believe this case went on for so long . seems like the jury couldn  t see the truth  even if it bit them on the ass . i feel for this family  and if i could let them know i hate what has happened to them  i would . i have no idea what they went through  i cant even imagine it . after watching this movie  i was in tears  and had to check on my little girl in bed . . . i think everyone should watch this .
