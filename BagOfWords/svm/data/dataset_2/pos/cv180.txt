ah  i loved this movie . i think it had it all . it made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times . yes  i am a girl  so i  m writing this from a girl  s perspective . i think it  s a shame it only scored  .  in rating . too many guys voting  it was far above other romantic comedies . just because i  m female i don  t enjoy all chic flicks  on the contrary i prefer other genres . romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be . but like i said  this movie had it all  almost  in my opinion . great script  good one  liners  fine acting . although eva longoria parker  s character reminded very much of gabrielle from desperate housewives  but so what  it was awesome . i will keep this film for rainy days  days when i feel low and need a few laughs .
