this night listener is better than people are generally saying . it has weaknesses  and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis  no doubt  but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this . the whole thing feels like one of those fireside  this happened to a friend of a friend of mine  ghost stories . one big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate . everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility  and real life just sort of plods alongno  so there are no flashy endings or earth  shattering revelations  no  showdown  scenes . thank heaven . you have to get into the zone when watching this movie  forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a  conventionally  good movie . williams isn  t terrific  but he easily meets the needs of the story  plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic   no one   as he is the everyman  the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story . toni collette  s performance should be nominated for an oscar  even if she maybe shouldn  t win it  . give it a shot . for quality and content alone  the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days .
