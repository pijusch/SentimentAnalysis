this film really deserves more recognition than its getting . it really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties  favours and allegiances within the crime world . the film is shot beautifully and delves into all you  re classic crime themes such as betrayal and power . this film is a movie goers film  it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end . it is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting  martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china . it features an arrangement of great characters  actors and development although is fair to say i had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film . all in all     great plot characters but there are characters that don  t stand out enough and the music didn  t really get me going and at times i felt it didn  t sync well with the action  there is action by the way  so it loses some points for that .
