very nicely done movie . it does stay in your memory . better billed as a romance than flying or war  altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free . flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes  unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love .  br    br   fun watching early crowe . he is good and exudes charm . his reading of  high flight  is superb .  br    br   cheers  boom
