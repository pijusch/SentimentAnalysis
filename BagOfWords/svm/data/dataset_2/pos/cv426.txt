almost   years later i recall this original pbs film as almost unbearably tender . periodically  i check here at imdb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a dvd . it  s september of      and i keep hoping   deep sigh .  br    br   one of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a prime  time evening soap the other  frances lee mccain  was seen in small roles here and there for a few years . but nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced  as i recall it  on a short  lived pbs series which showcased original screenplays by new and up  and  coming playwrights .  br    br   i watched it every time it was shown on pbs  maybe  or  times . that was before the era of vcrs  so i have no record of it  except in my mind  s eye .  br    br             addition to above happy new year  ladies  this wonderful film is finally available on dvd at ladyslipper . org . my understanding is that the dvds are burned from the writer  s own personal copy .
