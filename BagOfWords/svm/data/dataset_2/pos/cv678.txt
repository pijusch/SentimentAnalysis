a sweet  natured young mountain man with a sad past  henry thomas  comes upon an abandoned baby girl in the woods and instantly falls in love with her . the town elders generally support him in keeping the child  though a local temptress  cara seymour  thinks little of the new family . a determined little girl on a long walk and a sinister travelling salesman  david strathairn at his creepiest  have parallel stories which converge in a fateful way . this is a charming slice  of  life in the ozarks in the same vein as  where the lillies bloom    the dollmaker  . all three were shot on location in those beautiful hills and cover the lives of simple  living   but not simple  minded   american folk . a minimum of strong language and brief but pointed violence make this fairly  safe family viewing .
