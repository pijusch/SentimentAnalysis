the performance by om puri  smita patil  and sadashiv amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely  along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by govind nihlani . the dialogues by vijay tendulkar is also great .  br    br   i have not seen another movie like this . it is one whole  each piece so nicely fit in the plot . you cannot not be impressed by this movie .  br    br   amrish puri comes off as the bossy husband and  baap  of om puri . om puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system . sadhashiv as rama shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain . the first meeting of anand velankar with rama shetty  s at sadhashiv  s place is absoulely stunning . smita patil does not play a main role  but her part is also not distracting from the main plot .  br    br   and to add to this all kafi inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings . saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble . he is also the  guru  of om puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble .  br    br   the movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody . om puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in ardh satya .  br    br   a treat to all avid fans of indian cinema .
