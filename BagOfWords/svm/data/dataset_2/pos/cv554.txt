sisters in law will be released theatrically on march   th in sweden . a good occasion for our nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary . it was shown in gteborg together with a retrospective dedicated to kim longinotto   director in focus  of the festival . she gave a master class  very much appreciated  telling about her method as documentary filmmaker and told the audience about the special circumstances which led her to shoot sisters in law twice  the first version got lost for good  so a second shooting was organized and the film turned out to be different at the end . a pretty awful problem happened  in this case  to create the possibility of a very strong movie .
