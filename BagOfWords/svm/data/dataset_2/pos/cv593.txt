whether it  s a good movie or not  films of this kind has to be made  i think . it remembers me of  i love huckabees   a overwhelmingly puzzling movie with isabelle huppert being sodomized by a young american in a mud pond  in a merry sadistic  masochist way         . i hope the director will go on stepping across the border  as though i felt the choices vincenzo natali made  were not always subtle  some of the scenes were unhappily kind of  tarte    la  crme   like a childish slapstick   speaking about script and cinematography the color of  cube  was black   nothing  is white  more cheerful  surprisingly  than the former films of natali .
