  hatred of a minute  is arguably one of the better films to come out of michigan in recent years . not to say that it  s a brilliant film by any means  but it  s definitely worth a watch .  br    br    hatred  chronicles the sordid adventures of eric seaver  played by director kallio   a formerly abused child now grown up  and starting to listen to his evil side .  br    br    hatred  is very nice visually . the shots are creative  and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at . this film actually has an element of production value to it  unlike other recent michigan releases like  dark tomorrow  and  biker zombies .  subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film  s         budget .  br    br   however   hatred  stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do  and that  s in the story and character department . essentially  things just kind  of happen . eric seaver doesn  t evolve at all . basically  he  s always been crazy  it  s just that people are starting to notice . the film just wanders along its merry way with very little development . also  the ending is very abrupt .  br    br   however  since this is a horror film  since when do we care about plot  we just want to see people die  and  hatred  certainly delivers . as the body count mounted  people in the theater started cheering  kill her  kill em  all   when people scream back at the screen  it  s always fun .  br    br   that  s the place where  hatred  succeeds . it  s fun . and in the end  that  s all that really matters .
