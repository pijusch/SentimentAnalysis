this movie is not about entertainment  or not even a movie you want to see to pass the time . this movie is a genuinely a display of true love that can only come from god . one cannot help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie . we have several dimensions of love that contributes to the value of this movie . there is the divine love of god that is beautifully portrayed . god  s love transcends the heart and mind and endures and is eternal . there is the love in a marriage . while the main character grapples with his wife  s disease  he realizes through god  s love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine . he knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated . finally  you have the love of child and parent . the kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear . dear friends  love is not love unless it comes from god  because god is love and love comes from god . talk to someone and let them know you love them . love does no good unless it is given to another . i pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it . amen
