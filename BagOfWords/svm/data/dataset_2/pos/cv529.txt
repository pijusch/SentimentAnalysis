walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in cinema . how do you get laughs out of other people  s misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too long   br    br   well  this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs  beautiful scenery  and quite a good buzz as well . i particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white europeans liked it  and marijuana illegal  since  those other races  used it . . . undoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the world .  br    br   an extraordinary  dvd extra  commentary . . . two of them in fact . . . run thru the whole movie with both the actors  and then again with the writers . i kept seeing things i was sure were not in the first movie  but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take . what a hoot  don  t miss it      stars
