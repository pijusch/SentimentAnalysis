i originally caught this back in     in its one week run at a movie theatre . i was under impressed by it and my feelings haven  t much changed .  br    br   documentary about the infamous edward d . wood jr . covering his life and movies . there are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him . they include vampira  dolores fuller  bela lugosi jr .  loretta king  gregory walcott and paul marco . interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations . it is interesting  somewhat  but was this really needed  i  ve seen all of wood  s films and they  re just terrible . wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out . i wouldn  t say he was the worst director ever but he  s down there . do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker  i do like the fact that they didn  t try to make wood out to be some sort of saint . more than a few of those interviewed  especially lugosi jr .  pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear . also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the     s and   s . still it  s of interest if you  re a wood fan . the best interviews are with vampira  who tears wood apart  and dolores fuller  a long time girlfriend  .
