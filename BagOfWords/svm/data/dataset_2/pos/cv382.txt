melvyn douglas and joan blondell co  star in  the amazing mr . williams   a     mystery  comedy that  s quite good  although forgotten  probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in     .  br    br   douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job  while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed . what happens in this film is no exception  he  s called to a murder scene just as he  s about to walk down the aisle yet again .  br    br   both stars were excellent at comedy  worked together well  and often   and help make this battle of the sexes fun . edward brophy and donald mcbride are on hand for excellent support .  br    br   as you can read in other reviews  melvyn douglas doesn  t make much of a woman .  br    br   entertaining if a little on the long side .  br    br   one of the comments here trashed melvyn douglas  one of our greatest actors . he literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man . he wasn  t lazy  but rather  a very hard  working actor  who made it look easy  who had a broadway career simultaneously with his film career . he just wasn  t cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system . i challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in  hud  and  i never sang for my father  and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk .
