a beautiful postcard of new york . the thing i enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear . it never did . my teenagers liked it too . my son for natasha henstridge and my daughter for michael vartan . my wife and i commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something . this film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done . the ending came with a twist which we all liked too . if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you . as a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did . i recommend it and we need more of these films to watch .
