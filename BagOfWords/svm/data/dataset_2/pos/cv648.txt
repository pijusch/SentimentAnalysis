  footlight parade  is fascinating on so many levels . there is no way the supposedly staged  theater prologues  could have been produced in any theater on earth  of course . think of the huge pools and three  story tall fountains for  by a waterfall   for instance .  berkeley directed john garfield in  they made me a criminal  six years later and had the dead end kids singing  by a waterfall  as they took their showers .   br    br    shanghai lil  is the best production number in the picture . it  s a catalog of    s warner bros . sensibilities . note the african guys mixed into the scene with white and asian prostitutes . you would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house . here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others . i also get a thrill when the military dancers do a  card section  presentation of roosevelt  s image . there  s also the nra eagle   the logo of the controversial national recovery administration of the new deal . fdr was the new president and hopes were so high that he  d pull the nation out of the depression . you  d never see something so working class oriented coming out of mgm  of course . warner bros . wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the f . d . r . administration .  br    br   dear little miss ruby keeler was never better than she is playing the chinese hooker   lil .  she hardly even watches her feet as she dances  which was one of her signature flaws .  br    br   the pre  code stuff is fun . the  by a waterfall  number is wonderful in that regard . the girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through times square with all its lights on . the spread  eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for   years . in a few months the production code would eliminate such naughty pleasures .
