this is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all . generally speaking  i am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories . and this one is great  besides meryl  s performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise  the movie  s greatest asset is the story it is based on . the riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture  after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eye  opening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans  and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society . it is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people  the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example  are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would  for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices  shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions . the other face of the so  called  civilized  society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings  needless to say  this is very general  even though this specific tale unfolds in australia   that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty . must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought  provoking .
