 . . . heads  hands  and feet  a band from the past  just like strange fruit . a triple whammy there . those who have professed not to like this film are either heartless or under    and have had no experience of the real thing . sad for them . this is an achingly well  observed little picture that is an excellent way of passing an hour or two  and will probably not even fade much on the second showing . stephen rae  timothy spall as the fat drummer  in many ways quite the most delightful figure of all   and bill nighy  a new name for me  as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn in super performances  and juliet aubrey has lovely doe eyes to go with some sharp acting as karen  who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly self  destruct .  br    br   the syd barrett  brian wilson echoes are loud and clear  mott the hoople rear up before one in all their inflated ridiculousness  and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute . don  t compare this with spinal tap or the rutles or the full monty  it  s unfair on all of them . the nearest comparison is the commitments  and that  s no bad thing . and any film that can conjure up memories of blodwyn pig  a band i do not remember ever seeing  but the name lives on  well  it shows somebody in the team knew what they were on about .  br    br   a small delight  and thanks for the memory .  br    br   oh . . . and i  ve got another one  stiff little fingers a  a  and what about steeleye span . . . spooky tooth . . . ten inch nails anyone   you have to see the movie or have been on the road
