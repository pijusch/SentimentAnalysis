henry thomas was  great  . his character held my attention . i was so  into  the story that i forgot it wasn  t real . i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was . the other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character . the way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring . i love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head  in that you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself .
