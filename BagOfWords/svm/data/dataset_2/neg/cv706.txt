i was really looking forward to this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that the scott brothers were involved . unfortunately my hopes were dashed  yet again we are led to believe that the kgb are a group of inept morons who don  t have a clue what they are doing . at one point there is a laughable scene where  kgb agents couldn  t handle one cia agent . i grow weary of these biased  one sided and completely inaccurate portrayals of the spy game that went on during the cold war . i find it laughable that the us is incapable of making objective movies about their involvement in ww  and beyond . just like the pathetic u      where we are led to believe that the us obtained the enigma machine  again  utterly false .  br    br   to its credit   the company  is very well filmed and acted . the locales are also exceptionally well realised . alfred molina puts in a great performance as does keaton  the conflict between them is very well done  . i really wanted to like this show and no doubt i will end up watching the other  episodes but i really wish that us productions would stop trying to portray their spies  servicemen etc as supermen who are vastly intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet . it gets old fast and seriously detracts from the plausibility of what could have been a      .  br    br   s
