i grew up on scooby doo where are you  and i still love it . it is one of my favourite cartoons along with darkwing duck  talespin  peter pan and the pirates and tom and jerry . this show though is good for kids  the voices are good  don messick and casey kasem are perfect as scooby and shaggy   the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation . however it is rather disappointing . i normally don  t mind scrappy  but when he appears to be like the main character  it gets annoying fast . complete with the catchphrase puppy power  scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual . also half the gang are missing after the first year  somehow it didn  t feel like scooby doo . and the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal  very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies . all in all  not as bad as shaggy and scooby dooget a clue  but this show is disappointing .     for the animation  voices  theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids . bethany cox
