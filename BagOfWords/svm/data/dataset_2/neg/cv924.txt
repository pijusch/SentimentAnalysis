normally i dont have a problem with gratuitous swearing in films  but this one really annoyed me . all they did was swear . for the whole film .  and  as someone else noted  get cancer  it was boring  rambling and pretentious . i wouldnt if i were you .  br    br   its also not that i dont like films which  as most people who like it will claim  observe life  . i love eat drink man woman  and all that happens in that is that a load of taiwanese people lead their lives . but i could relate to them . i have never met anyone who swore as much as the  actors  in this film  and i used to work on a construction site . so go figure . having said that william h . macy made me grin . once .  br    br       . avoid  unless you enjoy tedium .
