i picked this one up because the music was done by hans zimmer  a customer of metasonix modular synths  made by someone dear to me  . the jacket art says  the     version  .  br    br   i give it one point for a strong female  one point for cheezy dialog and one last point for meg foster  s light blue eyes  of which there are plenty of shots of .  br    br   it was fun seeing david maccullum casually swimming  the pool has a plexiglass viewing window    while his lady love was being chased by a psycho in greece .  br    br   the sets were marginally impressive  that is  rich people  s houses in l . a . and mendanassos  sp    where the castle was . i found myself wondering how they were able to keep up the cleaning with all the dust blowing around . the wind wasn  t fierce enough to be believable to me . i kept thinking that the animal pelts on the furniture must be nasty . . . etc . and realized that the film must be pretty boring if i am wondering these things when the supposed plot was unfolding . i stumbled over things like why did she light a fire  blow out the match  then throw the match into the fire   dumb stuff like that . it was clunky at best . oh well . robert morely got to have a bit of fun with his kooky geezer character and a nice vacation out of it .
