this could have been interesting  a japan  set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly  installed american family  but falls flat due to an over  simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director .  br    br   the film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare  i . e . the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they  re expected to  besides  it doesn  t deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as  generally  the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way  such as susan george seducing diplomat  friend  of  the  family doug mcclure and edward albert force  feeding his daughter a bowl of soup   br    br   at one point  an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually  he  s called upon to exorcise the premises . however  history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and mcclure  possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors  engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death  at the end of the day  this emerges an innocuous time  waster  tolerable at just   minutes but  in no way  essential viewing .
