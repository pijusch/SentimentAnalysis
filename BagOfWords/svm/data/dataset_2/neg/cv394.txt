i have loved this book since my  th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago . and i have read it to every one of my  rd and  th grade classes over my past   years of teaching . supposedly a movie had been made in the past  but i  d never been able to locate it . well  my students and i were all so excited when we heard that disney had brought madeline l  engle  s excellent book to the screen .  br    br   as i watched the movie  i had the highest of hopes . as the film went on  i became more and more despondent . they had botched it badly  never had i been so let down by a favorite book  to  film adaption . i understand that films can  t stick strictly to a book  but they don  t need to change things for the sake of it  most  if not all  of departures from the book were totally unnecessary   br    br   i kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie . well  it wasn  t just me . nearly every single one felt the same way   cheated out of the great story that madeline l  engle had so skillfully created   br    br   why  they wondered  did aunt beast look like chewbacca from the star wars movie  why couldn  t calvin  s hair have been red  why did mrs . which not have the proper  witch  like  outfit that was such a clever play on her name  basically  we all wondered   why did nearly every single detail have to be changed   br    br   i have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make . i am still waiting for that movie . this one was a wrinkle in time in only the broadest of senses . i  m going to write to peter jackson and try to convince him to take on the task
