now look  i won  t lie to you  but i only got this movie for   .   from a friend because it had danni filth  the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band  cradle of filth  in it . i expected of course violence and gore at its finest  as that is what mr filth can be portrayed as  amongst a plot line .  br    br   but dear god  i was oh so wrong . this movie seriously bites  big time . being a low budget film  haha  wait  make that zero budget   this obviously lacks the beautiful howard stern orchestra musical scores and the spielberg special effects . nope  it  s all one camera  bad angles  and bad blood scenes .  br    br   take for example when our star and violent fiend  mr filth  violently kills a mugger . a grab at the throat  and blood spits out  but oh my  it looks like there  s a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man  s shirt .  br    br   to you cradle of filth fans you  ll hear two songs throughout the movie  but with the camera angles and shoddy filming  they drag the overall pleasure of the song down .  br    br   my final comment steer well away from it . it  s blood  gore  breasts  and hey  even a shoddy story to go with it . so if you like appalling violence  near no voices  yes  there  s hardly any words in this movie   then by all means  buy it . but if shoddy movies isn  t your thing  then avoid it . don  t waste your money .
