i went to see the omega code with a group of other christians totaling about   people . we all expected a good piece of christian film  making . what we got was an excruciatingly painful  drawn  out  and pretty boring attempt at a film . it has good looking production values but also has poor acting  a weak script with lousy dialogue  and no real sense of direction . from the first   minutes we all knew it would be a long night . we all hated it  and some people in our group placed this movie as reeking of more cheese than  anaconda .  none of us could believe that the movie lasted less than  hours . flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography can  t save this bad  bad movie . i  d give it a  out of    and the rating is only that high because i rented the abominable  movie  werewolf       the night before i saw this movie .
