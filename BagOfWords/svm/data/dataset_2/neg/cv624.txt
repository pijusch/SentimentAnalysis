this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget . dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid  chase scenes are uniformly boring  and most of the on  screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film  s last five minutes  a briefly glimpsed port  a  potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the film  s chief villain   no prop is here without a purpose  . the whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of rodger corman  s studio when he  d give a first time director a few bucks and a camera   but without the discipline corman would impose .
