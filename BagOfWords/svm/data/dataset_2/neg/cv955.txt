this was a disappointing film for me . it came to me via a boxed set entitled   classic film noir   which was a gift from someone who knows i typically enjoy films done in that style  i insist that noir is a style  not a genre  . i do not think it is a noir film at all . there seems to be a tendency these days to label and market every black and white b movie made from     to     as noir  and the label does not always fit . there is a persecuted male protagonist  ed cullen  lee j . cobb   and most of the film  s action takes place indoors . those are just about the only noir elements that i could see . there is no pervasive paranoia  or any real reason why one should sympathize with ed cullen . jane wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale . i do not want to spoil this film for potential viewers . however  i would be interested in hearing what other connoisseurs of film noir have to say about it .
