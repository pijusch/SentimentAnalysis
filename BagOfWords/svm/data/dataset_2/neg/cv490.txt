i stopped watching this pos as soon as the snakes started  taking over  the plane .  br    br   at first i thought maybe it should get a  one  for the comic relief . but then i realized i could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more   br    br   whatever respect i might have had for samuel jackson has been irreversibly destroyed . and hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are . when i was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun . the only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay . and no amount of hollywood cartoon snakes can change that .  br    br   this movie isn  t worth a trip to blockbuster . be warned if you pay for it  the only  victim  is your dumb ass .  br    br   if you want to be really scared  i suggest the descent . if you want humor  go to your local stand up comedy club . their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash .
