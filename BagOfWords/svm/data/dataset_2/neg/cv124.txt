horrible acting  bad story line  cheesy makeup  and this is just the tip of the iceberg . i have never seen a worse movie in my life   minutes in i decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen . . . it didn  t .  aside from a nice breast shot  the movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse  and the same warehouse was used for at least    of the sets . you even see this same red chair in several different  locations  if you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment  not some warehouse which will echo all your actor  s dialog . .  note to producers  renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse  and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable  if you spend your money to rent this people i hope you got it with a return guarantee . . . you will be demanding your money back . . . i only spent   .   to rent this tonight and i feel ripped off .
