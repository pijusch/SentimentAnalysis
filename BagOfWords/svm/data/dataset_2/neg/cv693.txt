in an otherwise good review  loleralacartelort     says  the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum  anti  radiation  alloy . it is not that well  known . and the exact specifications are a secret . and why is it a secret well  why should they reveal it back then   if they where in a space race with the russians  then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation .  this is completely incorrect . there is  and was  no  secret  to radiation protection in apollo . the design and construction of the apollo command module has long been publicly available . it uses a lightweight  honeycomb  of aluminum and stainless steel . the entire outer surface  except the windows of course  is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin  thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re  entry . these materials are actually better at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space  charged particles  than lead  which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like x  rays and gamma rays .  br    br   space radiation is a definite problem for long term space flight because of the risk of big solar flares . but it simply wasn  t a serious threat to the apollo astronauts . the command module gave them pretty good protection during their brief     hour or so  passage through the van allen belts . they all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received no more than  .  rem  and usually much less . of the   men who flew to the moon    of whom landed     are still alive . only two have died from cancer alan shepard  leukemia  and jack swigert  bone cancer  . the rest died from heart attacks  pancreatitis  roosa   and a motorcycle accident  conrad  . these are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late   s  shepard would be    .
