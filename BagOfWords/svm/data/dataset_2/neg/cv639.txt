i was very excited when this series premiered in     . the premise was very simple and appealing each episode would be a one  hour mini movie directed by a famous  noteworthy horror director . then  when i finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown . some good episodes emerged from that first season  but all in all it was a mixed bag . i attributed it to the learning curve  and figured that season  would be a whole lot better .  br    br   boy  was i in for a shock . at least season one had a few good stories here and there . season   with the exception of  the black cat  starring the excellent jeffrey combs  was a complete and total loss to me . the episode  sounds like  may very well be the worst thing i have watched on tv in the last   years  and most of the other episodes aren  t much better . i really hope that season  turns this around next year  but i  m not holding my breath .
