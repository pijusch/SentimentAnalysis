del   you are the dumbest smart person i  ve ever met .   br    br   calvin   well  i had a brain  but they lost it in the re  writes .   br    br   i think what i find most egregious about this bastardization of asimov  s work was how the character of susan calvin was portrayed . in the books  she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists  able to think her way through a problem . here she  s just a damsel in distress  waiting to be rescued by wil smith .  br    br   there are passing references to asimov  s laws of robotics  but they are an afterthought to the cgi and action scenes .  br    br   smith is likable  as he is in most of his films  but honestly  the story isn  t that good . you figure it out long before these genius characters do .
