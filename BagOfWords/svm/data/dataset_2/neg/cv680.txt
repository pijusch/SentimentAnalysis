wow what a great premise for a film  set it around a film maker with writers block who decides to take up tango lessons . hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker whos interested in tango . gosh i wish i had that knack for genius . yes im being sarcastic .  br    br   it amazes me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made . come on unless youre a rabid tango fan  i do concede they do exist judging by the comments  or a die hard member of the sally potter fan club    theres nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it . even if youre into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting renovated or a man in wheelchair going along a road  br    br   coming soon the review lesson where a failed screenwriter from scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films hes seen . gasp in shock as theo robertson puts the boot into the latest hollywood blockbusters  weep in sympathy as he gets yet another rejection letter from a film company  fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well toned body . the review lesson coming soon to a cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to fund the movie  br    br   ps sally potter is unrelated to harry potter
