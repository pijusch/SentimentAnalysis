this movie was craptacular . i was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies  biggest antagonist was  in fact  myself . i played it beautifully throughout promising myself i would walk away  but only drinking another beer hoping it would auto  magically transform into something engrossing along the way . even in this state  i couldn  t help but notice that cuba  s acting was as flimsy as tracing paper . his obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards . burt came on the screen as a general  that  s right  a general  who wears too much makeup  . i fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival cuba  s  except mine was real and i stubbed my toe . recompense  recompense my stubbed toe
