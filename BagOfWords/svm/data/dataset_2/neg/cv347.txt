as an impressionable   year old  i liked the  love conquers all  philosophy of the   s sitcom  bridget loves bernie .  i did understand the controversy  which was about the romantic complications between a jewish cab driver  david birney  and an irish catholic school teacher  meredith baxter  and both sets of parents  harold j . stone and bibi osterwald as bernie  s parents audra lindley and david doyle as bridget  s parents  who have issues with the young couple  s interfaith marriage .  br    br   looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences  i am amazed that the show was even a success for one  albeit  highly  rated season . created by veteran tv writer bernard slade  who a few years after the show  s cancellation would write the successful play  same time  next year    bridget loves bernie  was a very light  superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight .  br    br   there was no denying the real  life chemistry between birney and baxter . but  in later years  both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects  birney in his short  lived role in  st . elsewhere  and baxter in  family  and  family ties   . here  they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge  which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject .  br    br   the show aired saturday nights between two cbs powerhouses  all in the family  and  mary tyler moore  . both of those shows were smart  funny and had enough of an edge  more so on the former that the latter  that kept my interest in the situation and the characters .  bridget loves bernie  was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles .  br    br   this was another example of a show that really was not as good as i remembered .
