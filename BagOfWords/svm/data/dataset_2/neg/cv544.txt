i notice that the previous reviewer  who appears to be still at school  gave this movie a very good review and i can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn  t seen the far superior     bbc adaptation of this classic novel . the major problem i had with this       version was the casting of anthony way as tom long . anthony way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the tv mini  series  the choir  . i can only assume that he was cast for the role of tom long on the strength of his excellent acting in  the choir  . unfortunately the small boy who appeared in  the choir  had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time  tom  s midnight garden  was filmed and as such anthony fails to convince as schoolboy tom . it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that tom  as played by anthony  would befriend the far younger hatty . in the     bbc version tom and hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable . for a     movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the     tv effects . the casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic . as a final observation i would point out that the vhs of the     bbc version fetches well over    .   second hand whereas a new dvd of this version can be bought for under   .    need i say more
