i enjoyed the first reviewer  s comment far more than i did the film when i saw it at a second  run theatre in the early     s . i was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the tenniel drawings . but to me  the cast was largely squandered  their personalities muffled by the masks  while the direction i think of as being unusually static  and the photography murky . the rating jotted down at the time was a nought  which means  not worth sitting through even once  .  br    br   still  i too would jump at a chance to have a second look .
