this movie looked good  good cast  evergreen topic and an explosive opening . it went downhill from there . why was it filmed by hand held camera  it shakes  judders  part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer . a poor choice indeed . as if this was not enough  the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer  mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all . and then it commits the worst sin of all . after leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion  they roll credits without revealing the denouement  the ending  the payoff  like what the heck was the motive  how can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending  doh  this movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud . what a waste of effort . poor effort by writer and director .
