i don  t know why this has the fans it does and i don  t know why i have even given it the score i have . this is preposterous . there are many a giallo where one has to suspend disbelief  let the picture roll and catch up with it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor police officer has to eventually explain what we have seen . but  this has very little going for it and has overlong sequences where nothing happens and have no relevance to anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive soundtrack  even by italian standards . not a giallo  this is a complete mish mash of horror ideas featuring klaus kinski in one his most blatant  phoned in  performances . i reckon he turned up  did a day  s work and cleared off leaving mr d  amato to get others to fill in . ewa is of course pretty but no it is not enough  and in the end we have seen far too much of her popping up all over the place  long after we have completely lost interest in this mindless and pretentious twaddle . maybe i just wasn  t in the right mood
