first of all  write the script on a napkin . who needs more than that  after all we  re not a hollywood film .  br    br   then get amateur actors . it will be good for the festival hype . after all  who needs people who have spent years honing their craft  then  hire a cinematographer who doesn  t know how to light . you see  if it  s well  lit  it won  t look  real  and the festival people won  t like it . who needs to have professional level photography anyway  then hire a ten  year old who has never held a camera to be your operator . it will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for  reality  and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people  critics and a small sliver of the audience who over  intellectualize will scream  genius  because they won  t believe this was just complete amateur  hour .  br    br   once you  ve done that  buy your ticket to the festival of bad movies aka sundance .  br    br   what a sad waste .
