the reason i intended to give this movie a chance to take  hours of my life  actually it was only   minutes  was my wish to try to understand and hopefully appreciate indian cinema . all i have ever seen were few older movies of s . ray .  br    br   browsing through imdb i came across this one and after seeing rating of  .  i concluded this must be the one which will open the doors of unknown and bring artistic enjoyment . oh my how wrong i was  the only logical explanation for this rating of  .  is that most of    people who voted are indian and their only venture outside bolliwood production were adam sandler movies .  br    br   with this rating this movie would be ranked on  th place on imdb list of    best movies above citizen cane  goodfellas of psycho  i am really not in a mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that i find worth remembering from this painful experience . my only hope is that there is a lot of hindu who like me find this movie as is   plain stupid  with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music .
