maverick cop with family problems and fondness of using his gun  check  isolated location with valuable object which is begging to be stolen  check  tasty looking love interest  check  assorted band of dumb cardboard cannon fodder villains with dodgy european accents  check  german sounding bad guy played by an english actor with a piece of corny dialogue for every occasion  check  corny one liners  check   br    br   deary me  does this film take the wee wee or what  the clichs come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just stand around gawping at just how bad the script is   br    br   in a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to video rip off of die hard only set on a mountain  complete with some nicked lines from the aforesaid  we have all the usual action move clich  s ticked off progressively as we go along with some good old fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake up anyone in the audience who may just have nodded off .  br    br   jack wild is the cop in full on john mcclane mode here who even manages time for the ye ancient bad guy with gun has used all his bullets gag at one point .  br    br   in amidst this mess  there are a few well known recognisable faces who i can only assume needed the cash and  or were simply playing it for laughs right from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever through to the final implausible conclusion complete with ropey dialogue and even ropier effects .  br    br   looking up this three quid from the supermarket bargain bin effort on imdb i am astonished to find that this dud spawned not one but two sequels  i have got to find these gems on dvd  it looks like the first sequel is a rip off of under siege  and the second sequel  well goodness knows  one thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing jack changes with each film and even the character  s name seems to change for the third instalment .  br    br   still  blind purchases of cheap dvd  s just would not be the same if studios didn  t keep trotting out material of this awful quality
