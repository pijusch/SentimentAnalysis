i bought bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago . i watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again . the excessive amount of watery  blood  at the beginning is just plain obsolete  not to mention the  whip  around  wind sounds . my friends and i made a super low budget movie  and the effects still exceeded this crap fest .  br    br   as for the amount of mistakes in this movie  there are way too many to count . i knew one of the actors  believe it or not  he was my theatre teacher . ha   br    br   final verdict don  t bother with this  horror  flick .  br    br    stars  out of a possible
