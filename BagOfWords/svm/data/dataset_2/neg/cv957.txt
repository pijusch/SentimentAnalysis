i watched like  or  herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me .  br    br   i watched several documentaries about him . he is obviously an intelligent man  with great knowledge about films and passion for making them  but does this makes him a good director . definitely no  a complete anti  talent . he can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits  but a film with actors  never   br    br   he can  t direct nor write . his screenplays are full of badly thought out situations  and many situations  dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word  art  in any sense . no way . not to mention the unskillful direction  so amateurish  like . to say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie .  br    br   like the scene when scheitz gets arrested and storszek hides in the back of the store . who is he kidding   br    br   he is a cheater he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want . he knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising . never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction .  br    br   just look at julio medem . if herzog can make a movie like medem can  then i might re  check his old movies and try to find talent in them .
