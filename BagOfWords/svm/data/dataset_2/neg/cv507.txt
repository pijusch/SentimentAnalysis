what can i say  i  m a secret fan of  over the top  action and horror films . especially when it comes with a lot of lots of humour and innuendo  but i  m not a fan of snake on a plane .  br    br   there are three potential draws to this film  the comedy of the situation  the horror and  the novelty of hundreds of snakes being of a plane .  br    br   firstly  this film isn  t written as a tongue  in  cheek horror or a comedy  and there are only  or  points in the film where you  ll smile to yourself . if you want to get the feel of the film  the trailer genuinely represents the movie  a horror .  br    br   secondly  if you  re expecting a film full of action and shocks  you won  t be disappointed . it doesn  t stand out above other movies  but it always keeps your attention .  br    br   thirdly  although the novelty of snakes of a plane doesn  t wear off  but you  ll leave the cinema thinking  what was all the fuss about  .  br    br   i know this movie has a high rating  but it doesn  t add up . a  many of the reviews where written before the film was released and  b  the breakdown of user ratings has a lot less variation than normal    of people rating the movie       with only   of people giving it      why such an enormous gap
