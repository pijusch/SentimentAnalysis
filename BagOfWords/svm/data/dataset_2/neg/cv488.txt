what a bad  bad film    i can  t believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious  amateurish excuse for a real movie   i left the theater before the end  stunned by how bad the direction and camera  work of that movie were   and to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a brazen attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and tawdry .  br    br   at least this film showed me once and for all that the sundance festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film  making than anything else .  br    br   avoid at all costs . you  ll want your time back  i know i did .
