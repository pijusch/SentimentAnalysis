i had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a yashraj film .  br    br   jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by pooja singh to teach her boss  lakhan singh  english . the two fall in love and decide to run away but pooja tells jimmy that she can  t do this as she owes a debt to lakhan singh  who is also known as bhaiyyaji . but they decide and steal money from him and its only then that jimmy finds out that bhaiyyaji  lakhan singh is a don . in the meantime  bhaiyyaji hires a man  bachchan pandey  to track down jimmy and pooja .  br    br   starring saif ali khan  kareena kapoor  anil kapoor and akshaye kumar  the movie is directed by first time director viay krishna acharya and is produced by both aditya chopra and yash chopra .  br    br    tashan  has to be one of the worse films that i have ever watched . yes  the scenery is good and kareena kapoor  and her much publicised weight loss  looks good . but plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other  hence why i have said at the beginning that i had expected more from this film as it was a yashraj production . with reference to songs  unfortunately  there is not one song that i can remember now .  br    br   there are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to akshaye kumar and saif could have definitely done better while kareena kapoor played her part well . but this cannot be said for anil kapoor  it did not suit him at all as a villain . lastly  never mind aditya chopra  who in the past has produced and directed good films such as  mohabbatein   what was yash chopra doing by producing such a trash movie   br    br   conclusion bad movie  not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression .
