i watched this movie last night and already i am struggling to recollect very much about it . the story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony . they fly to the moon in a space  age dustbin carrier when there  they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the moonbase .  br    br   it strikes me that rubbish low  budget sci  fi films often involve either desert planets or  like this movie  criminals escaping from penal colonies . why this is i have no idea . but i can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical . this one is really no exception . it begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half  way alright dance music soundtrack . it then degenerates into a boring sci  fi thriller . so little of consequence actually happens in this movie that i am literally struggling to write a helpful review  so if you  re reading this i apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the film  s subtleties and nuances . for the record  i recall a tedious bunch of baddies  a tedious bunch of goodies  some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman . other than that  i  m struggling .  br    br   if you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then i would not hesitate to recommend this film . i would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets .
