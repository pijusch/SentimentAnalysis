alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think ofhe set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him .  br    br   the main subject of this bullock vehicle  all the ideas  almost everything was already in hitchcock  s classic  rope  the two students who commit a gratuitous crime  nietsche  s philosophy  and the clues that the boys disseminate  the master was the first to transfer them to the screen . and with an eighty  minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force .  br    br    murder by numbers  does not take place in a single room  like  the rope   mind you . and  what a supreme originality  it pits two cops against the evil youngstersand  you would never guess it  these two cops are very differentactually  bullock plays the part of woman living like a man  and her partner  chaplin  is as shy as a clueless girlie . the two boys  performances are not really mind  boggling  not as good  as  say  that of edward norton in  primal fear  .  br    br   well  you know   rope  was so good . . . .
