the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency . there was a bit  but precious little  of good acting  primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg  who only appeared once and had no lines . otherwise the acting was decidedly bad . the plot line was rather weak  and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation . certainly not one of the year  s best .
