i remembered the title so well . to me  it was a flora robson movie with olivier and vivien leigh in supporting roles . and it had vincent massey  s voice from behind whiskers . well flora robson was great . her next signature  for me  would be    days at peking  . the same role but with different sumptuous gowns . and the same voice . as for the armada  it was a subtext . i like black  and  white films . was everything done in elizbethan times at night  it was talky and difficult to fathom  at times . i couldn  t tell which was the love interest . was it the spaniard or was it vivien leigh  and i do not believe that elizabeth i would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the armada . apparently it worked for the empire  but not for the script . this might have been more accurate  historically  but bette davis had more engaging scripts . and i missed daylight
