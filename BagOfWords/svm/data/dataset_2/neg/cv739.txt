i am a big      s movie fan and will watch most anything that i see on turner classic movies thats new for me . so i gave this a shot  after all it  s the great harold lloyd who rivaled chaplin as a great silent film comedian . i have watched much less of lloyd  s silent films then of chaplins but i have to say i  m a much bigger chaplin fan . anyway this film fell so flat for me that i didn  t finish it . i can understand why his sound career was so limited  he didn  t get very good material to work with . after you  ve seen chaplin  abbott and costello  the three stooges  martin and lewis  the marx brothers  and laurel and hardy do boxing spoofs  or violence in general   this one is very forgettable . i was also interested in watching adolphe menjou as i really enjoyed him in paths of glory but his role here also did nothing special for me . maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film  at least it seemed that way  is before he gets in a ring . i can tell there are a lot of lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but i must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time   out of   . don  t watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again  very flat . for an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general i recommend  kelly the second  made a few years earlier  another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with patsy kelly and in a supporting role charles chase . these have both been shown on the turner classic movies channel .
