this tv movie goes to show that bad films do exist . the only reason i saw this was it was covered on a ktma mst  k . it  s super bowl at the superdome in new orleans . however  no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing . with the many stars in this film  it made no difference . i really don  t know why i watched this .
