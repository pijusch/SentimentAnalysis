i think the croc hunter is a pretty cool guy  i know i wouldn  t have the nerve to go even  feet away from a croc .  br    br   but  everything in this movie is bad . farting jokes  people getting eaten  and the skit about the president all make the movie one of the worst of all time .  br    br   it  s a really bad film that you have to stay away from . all the  jokes  are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid . the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is  years old .  br    br   i  m surprised the croc hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this .
