this film is a very funny film . the violence is bad  the acting is . . . well dani  stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do . the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually  frustrated goth lads in . personally  i think this movie really does suck . the story and characters could be very good  if say the directing  the actors and other little nibby things were made better . but the film is just bad  the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has danni in it . this film is possibly the worst b  rate film ever . and  believe me that  s hard to achieve  especially when you  re competing with def by temptation and over crappy excuses for  serious  horror movies . i  m not a cof fan  and so i just see this as another rubbish movie . . . a really bad one . if dani made this as a comedy then  good going him . very well done . over than that though  i rate it low  for it  s crappiness . watch it when you  re in a happy  happy  joy  joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you  re high on multiple different types of drugs .
