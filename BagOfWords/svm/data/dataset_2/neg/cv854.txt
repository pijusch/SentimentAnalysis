this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen . branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldn  t deliver his lines . the plot was definitely not worthy of john grisham  s name . no wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters . i didn  t even watch the whole thing . i decided i didn  t care who done it  then realized there was no  whodunit  to care about
