i have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film . i even got the rental company to give me my money back because i argued that they perpetrated false advertising .  br    br   it  s not enough that the movie itself is a p . o . s .  but the cover art is what sold me . i  ve done better make  up effects on my children at halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art . can you say  raccoon eyes    br    br   i  m not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details  but come on  the movie  s main character is an l . a . cop who was born and raised in alabama  but has a german accent    it  s beyond insulting .
