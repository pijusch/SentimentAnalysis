first of all  f    is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft .  br    br   secondly  the f    s and f    s cannot change their appearances they are not transformers .  br    br   thirdly  the f   has only one m   cannon  not two .  br    br   last but not the least  at the end of the film  seagle selected sidewinder missile . but somehow when he pulled the trigger  the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick . as i have the experience of seeing f    s and f    s being mysteriously transformed into f    s  this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me . however  there is still one question i have to ask how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f   . . .  br    br   when students hand in really bad work  teachers assign   s . now i think for the sake of properly marking this film  imdb should seriously consider adding a       option . otherwise  it is not fair for those who receive  out of   . . .
