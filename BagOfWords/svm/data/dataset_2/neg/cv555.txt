en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track  but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway   a female reporter runs into a strange hitch  hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination . the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area in the first story  an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman  s husband  but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie and in the second story  a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on .  br    br   the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea  but with only two stories  it falls woefully short . and that  s not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver the acting is lousy  with joe haggerty  as the tale  telling ebenezer jackson  giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen   the locations are uninspired the script is dreary there  s a sex scene with zero nudity and the ending . . . . well  that beggars belief .  br    br   to be fair  some of sykes  creative camera  work is effective  although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused  and joe castro  s cheapo gore is enthusiastic an ear is bitten off  eyeballs are plucked out  a face is removed  brains are squished  and there is a messy decapitation . these positives just about make the film bearable  but be warned  the zombie chronicles ain  t a stroll in the park  even for seasoned viewers of z  grade trash .  br    br   i give the zombie chronicles      but generously raise my rating to  since i didn  t get to view the film with the benefit of  d  although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn  t have made that much of a difference  .
