having been pleasantly surprised by sandra bullock  s performance in miss congeniality  i decided to give murder by numbers a shot . while decent in plucky  self  effacing roles  ms . bullock  s performance in  serious  roles  see hope floats  speed     days  leave much to be desired . her character is at the same time omniscient  confused  and sexually maladjusted  the sub  plot of sandra  s past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character  . the two teenage boys gave decent performances  although their forensics expertise and catch  me  if  can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream  we did it   chris penn as the all  too  obvious suspect is wasted here  as is ben chaplin  s token partner  love interest character .  br    br   spoilers ahead mediocre acting aside  the biggest flaws can be traced to a tv  of  the  week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place  and as mentioned  the stupid errors  vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene  an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor  the two boys hanging out together in public  a convenient love interest to cause friction  etc . etc  cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers . the ending was strictly  by the numbers  and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie . using the now  cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film  and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment  the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so  called intelligence the film purported to arrive at it  s conclusion . a somewhat promising concept  but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way .  out of  .
