so  i  m wondering while watching this film  did the producers of this movie get to save money on sandra bullock  s wardrobe by dragging out her  before  clothes from miss congeniality  did ms . bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the  before  gracie hart  as many reviewers have noted before  the film is very formulaic . add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of cassie maywether as a somewhat darker gracie hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest .  br    br   the two bad boy serial killers have been done before  and better  in other films . as has the  good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence  character been seen before . in fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes .  br    br   one last peeve  using the term serial killer is false advertising . murdering one person  even if it  s a premeditated murder  does not make you a serial killer . you may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer .
