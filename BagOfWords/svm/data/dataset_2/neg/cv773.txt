first of all i thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by preston sturges . sturges was one of the better hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired . however  it wasn  t the preston sturges  it was preston sturges  jr . the story was essentially based on robert louis stevenson  s short story  the bottle imp  . a good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell . that  s fine . nobody said screenwriters had to be original . the actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen . my biggest complaint comes with the ending . the hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person . at first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film  they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film . this is a stupid convention . the older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end . there is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think . you can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end . in fact  i think it  s preferable .
