i saw this movie on a westbound american airlines flight . it was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer . the plot had potential  who wouldn  t love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every elvis impersonator she meets   but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing . towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking he  s going to return  then a group of stars moves together to form an  elvis  constellation  which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators  sending them crashing through the roof . bad . . . really bad . which is the theme for the whole movie . i  d avoid this one at all costs .
