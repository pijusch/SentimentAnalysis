time spent watching this film was time wasted . i do not dislike science fiction . i do not reject any genre per se  since good work can be done in any genre . this film  however is not good work . i cannot fault the visuals  when not involving alien makeups   and the special effects are impressive . the story was not out  and  out bad  for a trekkish comic book . but the fx visuals were obviously where all the makers  interest  attention  money went . the direction alternated between sluggish and confusing  one was not at all sure exactly who was doing what and with what and to whom at at least one crucial juncture  . the  acting  was mostly very bad indeed . there was no basis to most of the line readings besides a hint of  it was that way on the page and the director told me i was supposed to be mad  sad  scared  whatever . okay  so it was a sf series pilot . since when is that an excuse for correctable shoddiness in areas when should be regarded as essential to a dramatic medium . i  m astonished the pilot sold the series . or is the money also in the hands of technerds
