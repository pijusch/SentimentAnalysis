for two of the funniest comedians  the movie was awful . fast forwarded it and never got any better  waste of time and waste of money  tina fey is such a great writer  i thought that she would be so great in the comedy . the previews were so great  but they only showed the best parts of the movie . my husband even thought that for a chick flick  it sucked . what is up with that . movie was very slow ans boring . i will not recommend it to anyone at this time . i would like my money back for this one  boo from us here in arizona . thanks but no thanks . who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant . i thought that it was going to be so funny  i have had my own children and i have helped others have children . it could have been more along the lines of reality .
