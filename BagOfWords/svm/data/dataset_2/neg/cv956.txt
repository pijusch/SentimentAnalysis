maybe i  m missing something because i  ve read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews  and i just don  t get it . i like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak  look  and act like humphrey bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura . none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it . take the lead actor  lee j . cobb . his rumpled  rolled  out  of  bed look is about as far from the dashing  smooth  talking noir archetype as you  ll find . or  take jane wyatt as the femme fatale as another example . this is one of the worst cases of miscasting i  ve seen in a while . she  s just not convincing in the role .  br    br   as for the plot  it  s tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre . i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes . and that final cat  and  mouse chase scene is plain old dull . ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it .
