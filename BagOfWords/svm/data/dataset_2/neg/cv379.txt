i rented this movie from the library  it  s hard to find for good reason  purely out of curiosity . i  m a huge plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment . the bell jar       is by far one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen . the script is horrible  not because it strays from the original novel text  but because it strays without focus or intent . the scenes are ill  constructed and don  t lead the viewer anywhere . what  s with the hokey voice over of plath  s poetry  lady lazarus has little do with greenwood  s situation plath  s poetry was completely misused . marilyn hassett is completely unbelievable as esther greenwood  or any   year old for that matter  partly due to casting  she was   during filming  the age plath was when she died  and partly due to the fact that she can  t act . hassett is all emotion  no craft  no skill . the direction is mediocre the director simply covers what  s there  which isn  t much . the only reason i  m giving the film a  is because  isn  t an option . sorry sylvia  you  ll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting .
