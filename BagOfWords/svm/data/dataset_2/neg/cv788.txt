i have seen some bad movies  austin powers  the spy who shagged me  batman forever   but this film is so awful  so boring  that i got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest . a pity . boasting talent such as kenneth branagh  embeth davitz and robert duvall and a story by john grisham  what went wrong  branagh is a big  time lawyer who has a one  night fling with davitz . her father  duvall  is a psychopath who hanged her cat  etc  etc  so branagh has him sent to a nuthouse  and he promptly escapes . somehow  i couldn  t figure out how  robert downey jr  daryl hannah  famke janssen and tom berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than stationary . i wanted to like this  and  being a huge grisham fan  have read all about this movie and i  foolishly  expected something interesting . this is honestly the worst film i  ve seen to date and i wish i could have my money refunded .  out of  .
