i found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored . how can people possibly give this a    it  s not just that it  s supposed to be a feel  good redemption film  i think   because it doesn  t work on that level either . weak plot  bad dialogue  terrible acting there  s just nothing there . harvey keitel is decent  but has nothing to work with  and bridget fonda and especially johnathon schaech are just terrible . the plot progression  especially the relationship between byron and ashley  makes no sense . it seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it  without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow . it  s only an hour and a half  but that  s   minutes of your life you  ll never get back .
