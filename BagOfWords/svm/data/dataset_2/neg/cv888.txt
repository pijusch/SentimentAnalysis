if the crew behind  zombie chronicles  ever read this  here  s some advice guys  br    br    . in a  twist ending   type movie  it  s not a good idea to insert close  ups of every death in the movie in the opening credits . that tends to spoil the twists  y  know . . .   br    br    . i know you produced this on a shoestring and  to be fair  you worked miracles with your budget but please  hire people who can actually act . or at least  walk  talk and gesture at the same time . joe haggerty  i  m looking at you . . .  br    br    . if you  re going to set a part of your movie in the past  only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time .  br    br    . twist endings are supposed to be a surprise . sure  we don  t want twists that make no sense  but signposting the  reveal  as soon as you introduce a character  that  s not a great idea .  br    br   kudos to the guys for trying  but in all honesty  i  d rather they hadn  t . . .  br    br   only for zombie completists .
