i thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with  book of shadows   i was wrong . this film makes that look like  the magnficiant ambersons  compared to this piece of shameless  unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie . i  d write more but i  m still to angry that i was idiot enough to spend   renting it  bobbins .  br    br   and were these people english  and where is the forest  i have lived in the uk two thirds of my life and as far as i know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands . the whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation . those angels looked like anorexic pornstars  turned most of them were  did my research  . i did however like the bit when judd got ripped in pieces .  br    br   p . s i love and admire tom savini but he cannot act
