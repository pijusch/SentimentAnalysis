not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in bc  but easily the worst  never seeing the light of day . the director is not even canadian  but british  and boy does it show . we are all made out to be a bunch of over  sexed dope fiends and morons . the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent  and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk . of course the british character is normal . the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype  can you say  norm     the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes . the actors always seem to be fidgetting . are they as bored as the viewer  or is this the directors idea of cinema  avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films . a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically . you won  t be compelled to walk out on his films after   minutes .
