little mosque is one of the most boring cbc comedies i have ever seen . they have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most  easily  offended viewers which for cbc means   year old farmers in saskatchewan . the jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame i can  t believe it . the performances are very hammy and over acted but i don  t blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and demanded . very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as  controversial  well it is less controversial than the other boring cbc comedies like the hour has   minutes  royal canadian air farce and rick mercer  s report .
