this was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store . don  t make the same mistake i did . this movie is tedious  unconvincingly acted  and generally boring . the dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered i cringed at every scene they shared . dennis hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self his role was clearly not a stretch for him . and although the movie is supposedly set in puerto rico  it feels a lot more like a hollywood movie lot all of the main characters are caucasian and several tend to speak english with pseudo  irish accents . odd . anyway  when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store  keep walking .
