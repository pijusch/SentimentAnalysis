this movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie i  ve ever seen . and that  s saying a lot  considering i  ve seen such stinkers like demon of paradise  lovers  lane  and bloody murder  which is a close second  . however  i love bad horror movies  and as you can tell from my username  this one really sticks out . at times there  s nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick . as for this film  the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever  especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened  years prior to the rest of the film . the acting is nonexistent  and most of the camera shot are of women  s areas shrink wrapped in spandex . the policeman was the most stone  faced  monotone actor i  ve ever seen . the best  worst part of this movie  however  has to be the murder weapon . a giant safety pin   what were they thinking  who  s the killer  a disgruntled  huggies  employee  i  d have to give this movie an overall zero  but darned if i didn  t have a blast watching it
