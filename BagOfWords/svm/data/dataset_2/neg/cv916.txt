what made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to charlotte bronte  s brilliance of the original classic story . i was deeply disappointed to find that this movie  which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste  had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful . much of the witty back and forth between the main characters  jane eyre and mr . rochester  seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor . also missing was jane eyre  s charismatic sense of self  which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all . the original jane eyre was a hero . the woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over  including one of the greatest parts of the story when jane runs away from thornfield and mr . rochester . her struggle to find food and shelter  her shame at having to beg for bread  the threat of freezing to death in the cold  all to get away from a man she loved were  in my opinion  poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie . the title character seemed dry and uninspired . the story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book  i cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting . the screenplay and direction did little if any credit to the classic story .
