in fact  these young people were so distasteful that i couldn  t wait for all of  em to get slaughtered  and that includes clarissa  joanna canton  since i considered her the most annoying of the bunch .  br    br   but i knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the leslie gore music playing in the background . it had nowhere to go but down .  br    br   even the prosthetics looked fake and the  blood  looked suspiciously like hawaiian punch  although later on it took on red day  glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing . i  m sure all the goth morons out there will appreciate this bullsh  t since it  ll appeal to that bunch . it sure didn  t appeal to me . blah . . .  br    br   and not even my favorite horror babe adrienne barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself . she still looks hot  though . i  m glad she takes care of herself since we don  t get to see too much of her nowadays .  br    br   however  it is a step up from dante tomaselli  s meandering horror       in that it has a somewhat coherent plot  so i  ll give it that much . that and the little boston terrier named boozer also brings it up a notch . i like what boozer does to clarissa in the end . it was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film .  br    br   lion  s gate films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up .  br    br    out of
