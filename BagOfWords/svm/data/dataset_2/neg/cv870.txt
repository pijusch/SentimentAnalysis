it was disgusting and painful . what a waste of a cast  i swear  the audience     full  laughed twice in   minutes . this is not a lie . do not even rent it .  br    br   zeta jones was just too mean to be believable .  br    br   cusack was ok . just ok . i felt sorry for him  the actor  in case people remember this mess .  br    br   roberts was the same as she always is . charming and sweet  but with no purpose . the  romance  with john was completely unbelievable .
