this juvenile  bland flick is strictly for teenagers in old mens  bodies  desperate to relive their hormonally challenged teenage years . how  by burning up gas and equating a fast  reckless car  or plane  with freedom .  br    br   the plot borrows heavily from mister rogers  neighborhood  if it were run my an oil conglomerate  and logan  s run  if it were heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style  .  br    br   starring lee majors and burgess meredith this film is set in a post  gas  crisis world in which an all  powerful government doesn  t want you to  ahem  drive your car and burn gas . sort of the opposite of today  s enron  and  bush  oil  grabbing  suv  pushing government .  br    br   this juxtaposition alone makes the film laughable . but wait . . . there  s more . although the film is set in the future  we  re not shown any signs of future technology  beyond a return to bicycles  golf carts and horses . you will believe that the future looks . . . exactly like today . same clothing  same suburban houses  same green lawns as today and when the film was made . there are no solar panels  no windmills  no concessions to alternate energy .  br    br   the acting is flat and flavorless . even scenes which could have been gritty or moving  buddy  flick  honor  romance  horror . . . all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase .  br    br   continuity is lacking   the jet flown by burgess meredith  s character changes colors and configuration from moment to moment as the filmmakers insult our intelligence with unmatched stock footage again and again .  br    br   the plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as a dukes of hazzard episode .  br    br   even die  hard car  film and sf fans should avoid this film like month  old roadkill  unless you enjoy heckling exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the hero  s gas tank .
