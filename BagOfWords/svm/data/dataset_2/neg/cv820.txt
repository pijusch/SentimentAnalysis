  iedereen beroemd  has everything we can expect from a straight to video  movie . it  s the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star . the only thing he needs is to get her on stage  surrounded by cameras and reporters . a simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail . the problem with the movie is not the basic plot  but how it is made . everything is supposed to be funny  but it isn  t . it is trivial and clumsy  the characters are shallow  and the end  sequence is totally without climax or emotion . the last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing  but only at how pathetic the whole set  up is .
