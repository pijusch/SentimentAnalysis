let me start by saying that i consider myself to be one of the more  most   open  minded movie  viewers . . . movies are my passion  and i am a big regular at my local cult  movie  rental  place . . . i also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice about movies whenever i get there  and i never seem to be able to leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas about what is going on in the cult  movie  area . . . i love to rent strange stuff  and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys at the cult  movie  video  place . he told me he thought i had to see this  and since the cover said something about it being a movie with a jodorowsky  one of my favorites   atmosphere  i rented it .  br    br   the vote i gave here is not really fair  because i did not think it was awful  i just did not know how to rate it otherwise . a question mark would have been more appropriate . . .  br    br   this is the first and only film that literally made me sick to my stomach i actually felt physically ill  am i the only one whose stomach literally turned  still i did not want to turn it off  or maybe i just couldn  t because i was fascinated in a nasty way . . .  br    br   i do not ever wanna see this movie again .  br    br   not awful  a  as i said . just not my cup of tea  or wodka for that matter  . . .
