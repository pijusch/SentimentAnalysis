usually i  m a bit of a fan of the bad eighties  early nineties film featuring now has beens . . . but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through . guys dressing up as girls has been done to death  but never so pathetically . corey haim  s performance was abysmal as usual  nicole eggert was not much better . this has no redeeming qualities  even if you are a number   fan of an actor  actress in this piece of trash  stay away
