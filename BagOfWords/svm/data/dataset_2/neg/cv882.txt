would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball . this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level . in this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp . he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra . this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world  the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it .
