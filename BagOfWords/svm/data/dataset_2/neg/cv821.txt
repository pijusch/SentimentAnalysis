i can  t believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie  the gingerbread man starts of on the right foot  and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending . but at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories i  ve ever wasted my time on . it  s just so unbelievably how the bewitched mallory doss manages to pull kenneth branagh  s character around by his nose . the movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer  which has been left out in the sun too long . the gingerbread man is probably the worst grisham  movie ever and this isn  t changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie . don  t waste your time here
