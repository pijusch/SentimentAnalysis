firstly  i am not easily scared by . . . anything except for my few phobias  but this movie is absolutely horrific . this is not appropriate for children at all  i had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me i . couldn  t believe how gory it was for a children  s movie  bunnies being brutally murdered  it  s just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated g . i recommend being over  to see this . but don  t get me wrong  it was probably a good movie if i wasn  t scarred mentally as a child . i cannot believe a parent would allow a  let  s say   year old child to watch this . it  s just to intense and complicated  not to forget gory  for young kids . i  m wayy over  and i was shocked by the violence . i don  t recommend
