sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie . . . i had had a trauma after watching welcome       and thought that they wont do it again . but after loads of amazing promos  tashan finally ended as heart attack .  br    br   such amazing  songs in promo  dil haara  chhaliya and tashan mein . . . . . and what u get in the movie  zero story  predictable plot  plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight loss . . .     br    br   music  wise another major disaster . . . in the music album  they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these  jokers and they haven  t thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts . . .  that song is such nice  quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album       if you plan to watch this movie  i would say  watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like . . .  bachchan bachchan pandey . . .   br    br   overall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad english   br    br   go away man  i need to puke
