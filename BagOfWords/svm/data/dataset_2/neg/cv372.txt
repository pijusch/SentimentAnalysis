average  and surprisingly tame  fulci giallo which means it  s still quite bad by normal standards  but redeemed by its solid build  up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance .  br    br   the genre  s well  known weaknesses are in full gear banal dialogue  wooden acting  illogical plot points . and the finale goes on much too long  while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say limp affair .  br    br   fulci  s ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing  though . yellow clues wherever you look .  br    br    out of   limping killers
