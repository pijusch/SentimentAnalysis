cheap and mind  blisteringly dull story and acting . not a single good line  not even a line bad enough to be good  and no memorable delivery . even the blooper reel included with the dvd showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any of them were having . the esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic  and the antagonists failed to be creepy or believable . the  homoerotic  overtones were pointlessly tame and dissatisfying  and were limited to young boys caressing their chests while flaccid in their boxers . i  m not gay enough to appreciate it  but a little action might have at least kept me and my girlfriend awake .
