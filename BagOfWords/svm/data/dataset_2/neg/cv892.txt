ok so after watching this invigorating movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary genie comes out of ghetto boom box  gives this kid with shaggy hair  wishes  the kid wastes his wishes on i forget what  shaq sucks at rapping  and i guess thats it .  br    br   so mainly i laughed  i cried . . . . . . but mainly i laughed at the shear comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an nba player  rapper and boy with shaggy hair .  br    br   i highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good laugh .  br    br   i  m going to give it a  out of   only b  c the movie is based off of  magical wishes .  br    br   if i had  wishes one would be to erase this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like hollywood didn  t waste money on making this .
