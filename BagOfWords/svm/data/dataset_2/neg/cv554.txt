this movie has a very broadway feel  the backdrop  the acting  the  noise   and yet that  s all it has . some  sense  of a broadway without the bang .  br    br   the movie is slow  paced  the picture disjointed  the singing  pops up  on you so that you suddenly are reminded it  s a musical .  br    br   disappointing sinatra  br    br   intolerable sinatra  s fianc    surely  the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary .  br    br   tolerable mr  i remember the numbers on my dice   br    br   delight brando  s understated singing  very biased    br    br   surprise how much jean simmons looks like vivien leigh in her havana scenes . it  s the bone structure  how i would  ve killed to have seen miss leigh in a role challenging brando again .
