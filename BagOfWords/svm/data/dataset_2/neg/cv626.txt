the real shame of  the gathering  is not in the bad acting  nor is it in the despicably shallow plot . the real shame is that it was far worse than the series it begun  even though it did have one main attraction takashima . i would love to see laurel takashima in a room with susan ivanova  even for just five minutes . she has that sarcasm  that wit  that double  edged personality that is at once volatile and lovable . sadly  though  the  babylon   pilot movie has an incredibly dull story involving assassination . patricia tallman   who never seriously returned to the series until much later   fortunately got much better with age as lyta alexander  who here is little more than a whiny  tiresome telepath . i shall leave you with one final thought   why is it that delenn looks like some sort of outer  space frog man  even though she is a woman   thank heavens for the way the minbari looked later in the show .
