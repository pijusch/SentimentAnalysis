this was a blind buy used dvd . it totally killed a nice buzz i had going when i hit play .  br    br   it  s bubble  headed comedy  but it  s um . squalid . the plot is zany   but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived i ultimately found it depressing to watch .  br    br   maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven  goofy caper film .  i know  i know  the quotes on the box  the academy award nomination mean nothing .
