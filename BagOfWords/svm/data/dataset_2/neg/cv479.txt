i loved the first season . the quality went down a little bit in the second season  which however had a great middle  pegasus   . third season was fairly novel and original and was ok . fourth season started going downhill fast  because they never even began giving us any explanations  when by now we were really starting to need them . what the hell was the cylon plan  why were there two cylon factions  what was the point of angel  kara leading the fleet to a devastated earth    what kind of a past did the last five cylons have  and how did they survive  or were they reincarnations  questions everywhere  answers nowhere .  br    br   and then comes the end . earth    our earth  in the past . well  okay . but destroying the fleet   giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life  and spreading a few thousand people paper  thinly across the planet   that  s not only anti  science  it  s anti  reason and anti  life . and the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive a . i . that ruins everything . it is without vision  without hope for a grander future for humanity  and it is antithetical to proper science fiction . and don  t even get me started on the angels  religious claptrap of the worst kind  the ultimate disappointment    br    br   the whole  all this has happened before and will happen again  thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series  not just to earth as we know it . making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius . frakkin shame .  br    br    out of   .
