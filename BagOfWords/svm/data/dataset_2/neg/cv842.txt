in spite of the great future  design touches  the clever asimov premise  and will smith  s dependable cool performance  this movie doesn  t live up to expectations . the clichs come thick and fast  waking from a recurring nightmare  maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant  to list more would be spoiling it  you can see the end a mile off  . this movie is also stagebound  you never feel that you have travelled anywhere what  s supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously cgi chicago . the robots themselves are good in closeup  but the  crowd  scenes look more like bad disney  the cgi is overdone again and again . and if you can destroy the robots by smashing them  why do they need to inject  nanites   you know it  s a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax . it could have been great  but it  s less than the sum of its parts  mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years .
