when childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie it  s touch and go whether you should revisit it . anyway  i remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by jeff kober .  br    br    the first power  is not a very good movie  sad to say . it  s chock full of those cop clichs and a very poor script with holes a truck could drive through  along with countless convenient  twists  that help the story run along  . lou diamond phillips is the over  confident bad ass cop who sends baddie serial killer kober to the gas chamber only to find out he was a minion of satan himself and now has the power of resurrection along with the power of possessing every weak minded person who he comes across . through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the case .  br    br   ahhh  this is trash . but enjoyable as such  especially if you have fond memories of it . it scared me as a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good . as for any kind of logic here forget it  just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure and you end up with a cross between a steven segal action flick and a    s demonic flick . and who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast lou diamond phillips in the lead here  needless to say he  s not convincing at all but he tries his best and i  ve never had the problem with the guy so many reviewers here seem to have . as for tracy griffith as the psychic  the less said the better . but kober is pretty good as the killer always liked that actor .  br    br    the first power  may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day  s work and a  brain switch  off  is needed . beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and i  ll definitely have loads of it the next time i give this movie a spin . all in all not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids .  see you around  buddy boy
