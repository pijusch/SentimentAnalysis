strange how less than  hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat  uninspiring drivel . if a story is as personal as this supposedly was to sally potter  wouldn  t you expect a little passion to show through in her performance  her acting was completely detached and i felt no chemistry between sally and pablo and the tango scenes  which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance  were instead awkward and painful to watch . obviously  revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting  and as such sally potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness .
