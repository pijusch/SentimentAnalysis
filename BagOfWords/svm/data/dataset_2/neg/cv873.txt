let me put it another way balls . or  how about bolloks . this is truly awful  more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise . julia roberts is a skilled actress  and usually her work is of the highest standard . this movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient . normally she is the consummate professional  yet i swear that in her eyes  there were signs of bewilderment and despair .  br    br   the one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director  chris walken  turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors . unfortunately  that theme wasn  t explored to it  s full potential . too little  too late .  br    br   zeta jones was wooden  cusack was cusack  and crystal should stick to acting . the two talented ex  buffy stars had different experiences  green hopelessly mis  cast  and balfour under  used . well done to julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made .
