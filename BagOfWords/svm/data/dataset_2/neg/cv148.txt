unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under  minutes .  br    br   the plot  even for a seagal film  the plot is just stupid . i mean its not just bad  its barely coherent .  br    br   the acting  unbelievably wooden . literally seen better acting in porno  s . ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a  lesbian love scene  which is utterly cringe  worthy .  br    br   special effects  wouldn  t look out of place in a    s sword and sorcery flick .  br    br   unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures  don  t make the same mistake as i did and buy this dvd  as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back .
