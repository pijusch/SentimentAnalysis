i can  t think of much to say about this film .  br    br   this was an awful movie . . . i can  t even tell you what made me decide to view it . it had so few redeeming qualities that i don  t even know where to begin .  br    br   the plot moved from implausible to downright absurd . my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done . by the end of the movie  i found myself feeling beyond relieved .  br    br   the editing was poor  the acting was sub  par  and the storyline was weak . francoise robinson was cast as a native american  even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage .  br    br   if a movie is going to be this idiotic  it should be laughably stupid   at the very least . it wasn  t . it was just pathetic .
