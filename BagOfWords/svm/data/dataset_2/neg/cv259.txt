when thinking about captivity many words come to mind . among them are uninteresting  unentertaining  unsuspensful  unsexy  unfathomable  and unwatchable .  br    br   i used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of scream but these new saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics . they still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing  but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they  re aimed at feel like they  re hardcore and hip .  br    br   this movie is a load of boring crap  what the hell has happened to larry cohen  his name hasn  t been attached to anything good since      even so  i was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something this bad  was anyone surprised when the movie  s love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths  did anyone not know it when they first saw him  only someone who has never before in his or her life  ever seen another movie
