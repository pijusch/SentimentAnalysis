i think the show had a pretty good concept to work with . but the execution was poor . the script is poor and acting is bad . there were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way  like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard . the show can  t be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably . i should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of muslim community to some extent .  br    br   till now second season is worse than the first one . i had my hopes high regarding this show  but i was kind of disappointed . still i appreciate cbc for putting up such concept in front of the viewers . anyway i wish best of luck for the future .
