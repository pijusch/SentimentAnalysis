a very tired looking burt reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non  heroes plan to sell to  the iranians .  low  rent video nonsense by the producers of  silk stalkings  offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged  drama  . . . a lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects  although the final twists and allegiance shifts could  ve been a nifty end to a better movie . burt still has presence  although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly half  baked  one  liners  .
