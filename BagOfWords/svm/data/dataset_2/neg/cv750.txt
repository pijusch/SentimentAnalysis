camera work  why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy  this is annoying and distracting . editing  the flashes of the still pictures were way too short . many of the other scenes were too short also . just flashes . sound  the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices . one should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said . doesn  t anybody check these things and make them do it over again . please reduce the volume of the background music in future . is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor  julia wong  the plot had way too many loose ends . the basic story line had potential . i think the film needed more work . was it rushed  perhaps they ran out of money . like a lot of movies  it started out great but just petered out toward the end . i really don  t understand this  you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesn  t all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboard .  br    br   sorry to be so critical .
