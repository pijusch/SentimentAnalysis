the animation in this re  imagining of peter  the wolf is excellent  but at   minutes  the film is sleep inducing . they should have called it  peter  the snails   because everything moves at a snail  s pace . i couldn  t even watch the film in one sitting  i had to watch it   minutes at a time  and it was pure torture .  br    br   save yourself   minutes  do not watch this film  and you will thank me .  br    br   i can only guess that the oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees . unfortunately  to vote for the winner in the best animated short  short   category  the voters will have to sit through the whole thing . i already feel sorry for them  and must predict that there  s no way this film will come close to winning .
