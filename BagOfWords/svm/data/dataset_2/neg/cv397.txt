i have read the whole  a wrinkle in time  book and then saw the movie . the movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was    pages and the film was  hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting .  br    br   a wrinkle in time is about a girl named meg  charles wallace  and calvin must team together to find meg  s father and get off the island camazotz .  br    br   the beginning of the film is really a stinker . the acting is awful  the direction is laughable  and so far the situations aren  t necessary . i really was crushed to see the same person madeleine engle that wrote the book and created the movie  made a great book  and a terrible film . the acting is worse than any straight  to  video acting . yes  i got to admit there was cool effects . but seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible . if you read the book you will be crushed by the movie . i wish could give it a  but sadly i can only give it  . a half could have been useful .
