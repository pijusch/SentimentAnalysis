i  d never seen a tarzan movie before so when i saw it on the tele i thought i  d give it a shot . unfortunately i have to say i was disappointed . tarzan was over   years old and somewhat overweight . not how i  d imagined tarzan would look . and  unless i missed it while making myself a cup of tea  tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell . also missing was tarzan swinging through the trees  leaping from vine to vine .  br    br   oh well  so much for expectations . anyway  jane was there  the monkey cheeta was there . there was some guy with a guitar there . there were villains and good guys and a romance . . . all very harmless and predictable . nothing bad  you understand  but equally nothing good .  br    br   probably not the best movie to introduce tarzan
