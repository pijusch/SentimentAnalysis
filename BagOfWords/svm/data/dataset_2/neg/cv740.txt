don  t get fooled with all the big names like burt reynolds  james woods and anne archer . they are just glorified extra  s . their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so . whatever their motives for being in this movie  if you have an actor like james woods you better make good use of him . to me this is a sign of bad direction through and through . the plot itself wasn  t that bad . and the acting from most of the actors was above average . cuba gooding jr . however was terrible . he was so unbelievable that i almost laughed at his dramatic scenes . and since this was meant as a serious movie that can  t be a good thing . the action scenes were not bad  but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting . again better direction was needed . also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this . it took the main character almost half an hour to get in action . for an action thriller of only   minutes that is far too slow . the only redeeming factor is angie harmon . she does her best to make it all work . too bad the director left her hanging . yes  this movie could have been much better with a great director . andy cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off . and for an action  stunt coordinator of his caliber you  d expect at least more exciting action scenes . don  t waste your time with this one . avoid
