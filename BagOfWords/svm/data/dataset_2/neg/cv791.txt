this is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever  i emphasize  ever made . whats worse  my old hero dolph is in it and hes starring it . jesus . . . the story is actually quite good but the way its carried out made even my body hurt . the fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter . the actors  except for dolph who kinda sucks also  perform so badly you cant help but wonder if their reason for being there is that theyre all friends of the director  who by the way must have been absent most  if not all  of the time . this is    million spent in an unimaginable way  because by the look of the effects and scenery  the cost cant be a cent above      .
