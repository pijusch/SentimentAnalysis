filmatography excellent  nice camera angles  i don  t remember seeing a movie of late  with good close  ups  until this one  . could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera . ny is pictured good . i liked the upside down angles  in particular  a different touch  .  br    br   music not impressive . songs don  t stick around in your mind even after watching the movie . may be  i expected same quality like  anniyan  . a disappointment .  br    br   actors kamal needs to slowly pull away from hard  core action sequences . his age and belly really show up . also  he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward . it was a very awkward to see a mature  aged star still trying to play like a    heroes scenes . love can be expressed at any age as we get older  you still can express love nicely from a distance  without touching a woman too much . for example  the love expressed by rajinikanth in  chandrmukhi   .  br    br   jyotika just appears for the namesake in the movie . not sure why she accepted this . well  that is not my problem  i guess .  br    br   others just have a small presence .  br    br   direction i expected gautham to excel  or measure  up  to his other movie  kakka kakka  . he disappointmented me . it took a long time to release the movie due to various issues . he slips in few scenes . even abvious things got slipped from a famous director .  br    br   overall just a okay movie . too much graphics . definitely not for kids  and adults who expect some kind of  entertainment   .  br    br   thx
