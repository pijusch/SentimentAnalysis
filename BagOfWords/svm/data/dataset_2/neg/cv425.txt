this can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don  t take it seriously . it is a bit dated and the effects are lame  but it is so enjoyable . there are giant crabs that attack a girl . oh  and the crabs sing japanese . it is amazingly bad . and the ending  which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome . predictable  but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat . don  t even give this film a chance and you will love it . susan george is fun to watch and yes  she does appear naked . her daughter isn  t quite worth putting up with  but she does get attacked by giant crabs . they are the size of large cats . this is a   but i love it . as a movie  my god  but for entertainment  i give it a  . did i mention there are giant crabs
