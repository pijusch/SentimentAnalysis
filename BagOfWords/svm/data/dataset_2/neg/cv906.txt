oh just what i needed  another movie about   th century england . which is pretty much like regular england  only nobody  s vandalising football stadiums . in this picturesque setting of lords  dames and other randomly chosen titles  charlotte gainsbourg walks around aimlessly as jane eyre  from that novel nobody has ever read willingly . jane usually hangs out in mr . rochester  s crib  where she tries to teach a french girl to look at an empty chalkboard all the time . one day  mr . rochester  william hurt on auto  pilot  comes back to fall in love with jane and all that  but there  s still the matter of his fruitcake wife that is locked in the attic . oops  that wasn  t in the brochure . after some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire  they probably rented the set   the movie finally comes to an end . everything looked really authentic  that  s something i guess . but then again  nah .
