text1 = "The first film, a frenetic and hilarious tribute to superhero films and imbued with 1950s style, was an absolute masterpiece, with great characters and hugely inventive action set pieces. This one is a worthy successor. Thatâ€™s all you need to know"

text2 = "I'm not usually a fan of suspenseful movies, but this one surprised me in a lot of ways. Of course, it's not without its shortcomings: the foil is pretty easy to spot early on, and the monster is fairly unimaginative, but there's a beauty in its simplicity, particularly in the family's story, that draws you in.John Krasinski does it all, providing a great performance and excellent direction of himself and his peers. Even though it's never one to subvert your expectations, the thrill of seeing it all unfold is very enjoyable. Though I didn't particularly enjoy the ending, I thought the rest of the film was strong enough to make up for it.What it does well: The quiet, honestly, is done perfectly. It's not abused with jump scares, and really feels as if it's its own character.What it could improve on:Itwill, almost certainly, leave you with some questions.Why didn't they just do this?was a common discussion topic among my group."
